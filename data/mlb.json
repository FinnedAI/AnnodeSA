An analytical breakdown. I think it goes without saying that we have all been quite baffled as to why Counsel, a generally analytically sound decision maker, would chose to pinch hit Jessie Winker twice in what would be a disasterously quick exit from the playoffs.\n\n\nAfter all, Winker batted only .199 during the regular season, was worth -0.7WAR, and was coming off an injury that meant he hadn't seen a live MLB pitch in 74 days.  Combining all this data, we would expect Winker to get a hit in precisely 8% of At-bats.  So why in the world would you put him on the playoff roster at all, much less put him in the game?!?!\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, the missing piece to this equation was revealed in the recent AMA over on r/baseball.  As it turns out, pinch hitters perform 10% WORSE than would otherwise be expected.  (https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/185h7k8/hey_all_i_work_in_an_mlb_analytics_department_ama/kb27u64/) Because Winkers expected chance of getting a hit was 8%, this tells us that there was a -2% chance of him getting a hit as a pinch hitter! But we all know that you can't have a negative percent chance of something happening.  No, you see -2% actually wraps around to a 98% CHANCE OF GETTING A HIT!  \n\n\nObviously, we all know that Winker failed to get a hit in 2 attempts.  The probabilities therefore tell us that he would have gotten 98 STRAIGHT HITS AS A PINCH HITTER.  Craig Counsel found a way to create an unbeatable pinch hitting monster for a historic playoff run, it was only through horrible luck that we didn't get to see this brilliant strategy pan out.\n\n\nCraig, you will be missed, you brilliant galaxy-brained analytical genius.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9636}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "He was so magical ", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "Giving the ace his due in immaculate grid today ", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.34}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "Brewers Discussing Extension With Jackson Chourio ", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "The Brewers signed two more players to Minor League contracts with invitations to Major League camp, and the names are both 10/10: RHP Easton McGee &amp; OF Brewer Hicklen [via Adam McCalvy] Easton McGee\u2019s Minor League contract with the Brewers is a two-year deal.

Conversation wasn't steered much towards his work mostly mine. Anyways here's what we did talk about Brewers related...\n\nAre they rebuilding? It's officially being talked as an assessment period yet to gauge the market. They're hoping Glasnow gets traded soon and they'll expect a similar return for Burnes. If Burnes and Adames are traded they'll consider it a retool. Looking for players the can contribute in '24 or '25 at the latest.\n\nWoodruff injury? It's bad. Jimmy Nelson levels of bad. They wish all the best to him and are open to signing again if he proves to be healthy but it was crushing news. A contract offer was prepared once season ended if the injury didn't happen. This triggered the potential retool more than anything else.\n\nCounsell things. It shocked basically everyone. They went into the weekend knowing the Mets offer and were prepared to offer 3yr/22mil total. They went out of the weekend not having a manager and no chance to match. No info on when the Cubs reached out to Counsell but they assume it all happened fast like 3 days fast. They knew he wasn't going to the Mets and it was a contract negotiation tactic. As far as he knows there was minimal conversations between Counsell and office staff towards the end which was strange and believes there was strain but doesn't know about what.\n\nFree agents. Looking for a 3B. Probably not Chapman. Maybe Candelario. 2 year deal type situation until Black is ready. They will be in play for a pitcher if not just to eat innings. They were one of the teams to check in on Yamamoto if only to gauge price. Expect them to pick up someone like Flaherty or Severino if they think their pitching lab can tinker and course correct. International free agents they have a few hidden gems that they think no one else has discovered in Venezuela. Young pitcher nasty stuff they'll be targeting.\n\nOhtani. An Ohtani and Giannis pairing would be amazing for the Milwaukee economy but it's not happening. He thinks 10 year 480mil total just because of the injury. Thinks Cubs sign him though to 12 year 550mil. \n\nHoping the money they have for renovations will lead to the all star game coming back to Milwaukee. They want more fan zone stuff around the ball park to fit an event like that. Roof is first. Also since money is no longer ear marked for helping with renovations spending is expected to go up a little bit.\n\nPat Murphy. It was the safest signing to keep things moving the way they were. Murphy is the hard nosed leader the young guys need. Weeks isn't ready to be manager yet but is super impressive. He's ecstatic to be in the position. Murphy was going to retire if not offered the job, even if Counsell stayed. They're super confident with what they have moving forward.\n\nIn short... Woodruff hurt the most. Rearranging the shop. Counsell ghosted like a tinder date. Money good.

Rowdy, with his intensity both on and off the field, found solace in Daniel's easygoing nature and infectious laughter.\n\nAs the season progressed, their connection deepened. Late-night conversations in their shared apartment turned from baseball strategy to dreams, fears, and the intricacies of life beyond the diamond. They discovered a shared love for the game and an unexpected bond that transcended the boundaries of friendship.\n\nOne summer evening, as the sun dipped below the Milwaukee skyline, Rowdy took Daniel to their favorite spot overlooking Lake Michigan. The water shimmered in the twilight, mirroring the uncertain emotions in Rowdy's eyes.\n\n\"Daniel, I've never felt this way before,\" Rowdy confessed, his voice a mix of vulnerability and sincerity. \"You're like the missing piece that makes everything click into place.\"\n\nDaniel, usually the one with the witty remarks, was momentarily speechless. He looked into Rowdy's eyes and felt a warmth that surpassed the Milwaukee summer. \"Rowdy, I think I've been feeling the same way. It's like we're part of something bigger than just baseball.\"\n\nAnd so, their love story unfolded against the backdrop of fastballs and home runs. They navigated the challenges of a public life, finding strength in each other's support. The fans, who had embraced their friendship, now witnessed a blossoming romance that added a touch of magic to the Brewers' season.\n\nThrough victories and defeats, Rowdy and Daniel stood side by side, their love a source of strength. On the rare off days, they explored the city hand in hand, discovering hidden gems in the Milwaukee streets and forging memories that would last a lifetime.\n\nAs the final game of the season approached, Rowdy stood in the dugout, his heart pounding with a different kind of excitement. In a surprising twist, he arranged for a grand gesture during the post-game celebration\u2014a message on the Jumbotron that read, \"Daniel, will you be my forever teammate?\"\n\nThe stadium erupted in cheers as Daniel, standing on the field, looked up to see the heartfelt proposal. With tears in his eyes and a grin on his face, he nodded, \"Yes, Rowdy, a thousand times yes!\"\n\nAnd so, in the heart of Milwaukee, where the love for baseball intertwined with the love between Rowdy Tellez and Daniel Vogelbach, a new chapter began\u2014a love story that transcended the boundaries of the ballpark and echoed through the ages, a tale of two hearts brought together by the magic of the game and the magic of love.", "date": "20231121", "sentiment": 0.9985}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "Goodbye, thicc prince \ud83e\udd7a ", "date": "20231120", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "Clubhouse sale prices How much usually are authentic jerseys at the clubhouse sale?

As we get into the offseason, I think these things are fun to talk about, even if they're unlikely to materialize in real life. That being said, let's talk about Soto, because I think there's some very clear fit on both sides for a deal here. \n\n**For Cleveland:** He fits a very obvious short-term hole for the Guardians in right field. Obviously he's one of the best hitters in the game and one of the most disciplined, so he's the type of guy this front office should love. \n\n**For San Diego:** Cleveland has a lot of assets that fit what they're looking for. [They need cheap starting pitching](https://twitter.com/talkinyanks/status/1724428481197461579?s=46&amp;t=ZPrBLGnXZvWPV0N7a22TyQ) to remedy their payroll situation, and they'd probably be interested in prospects as well.\n\n1 year of Soto for 1 year of Bieber + prospects obviously isn't something the Padres would be happy with based on their situation. So the way I see it, trade talks would probably center on someone like Logan Allen with surrounding pieces. \n\nThe big question in giving up a starter is where that leaves our pitching. Our 5-man rotation becomes Bieber, McKenzie, Bibee, Williams, and Quantril. Not bad but not great, especially because there's still a lot of questions surrounding McKenzie and especially Bieber.\n\nWith that said, let's look at this from the perspective of overall roster construction. Last year we allowed 697 runs (8th) and scored 662 runs (27th). It's pretty clear that adding offense at the cost of defense would be a *highly* effective tradeoff for our team if we want to win more games, so I hope that the front office can see that when they look at things this offseason. \n\nIf we still want to entertain this idea, the main question is *what* could we give up that would allow both sides to strike a deal here? Before everyone rushes to the comments: I realize that the front office and ownership would be very unlikely to go for this type of acquisition (I'm actually not sure that they've ever done something like this), but I'm still interested in hearing everyone's thoughts.", "date": "20231114", "sentiment": 0.9939}, {"ranking": 0.3793103448275862, "comments": "Any Eric The Actor fans here?

This is what I believe they should do, not what they will do, and we have plenty of uncertainty with a new manager, 4 spots available in the batting order, and some uncertainty around what to do with Biebs, but these are just my personal thoughts.\n\n**Free Agency**\n\nThe Guards have never been huge players in free agency, we aren't going to give out huge contracts to anyone like Bellinger, Nola, Ohtani, etc. That being said I do think we will sign someone, as we tried last year and even if the signings of Bell and Zunino did not work out, I have some optimism that since they are both off the books, we'll try to make an addition.\n\n**Eric Lauer: LHP 2 year 5 M/Y**\n\nI think Lauer would fit this bullpen nicely as we need another lefty in there. He can provide bulk relief, be a spot starter in case of injury or workload, and should be available for relatively cheap even in this pitching market. He's about 1 year removed from being a solid relatively solid pitcher and a change in scenery and move to the bullpen I think could help him.\n\n**Reynaldo Lopez: RHP 1 year 3 M/Y**\n\nLopez showed to to be a solid relief option last year down the stretch with us and I'm hoping we can get him back.\n\n**Trades**\n\nThe Guards have quite a few veterans on the roster who I think will or should be traded this offseason. and while I believe that these guys could fit with us, we are bringing on a pretty big youth movement and I think the log jam will eventually hit with these guys, so it is time to move on.\n\n**Myles Straw traded to the Chicago Cubs for Kohl Franklin RHP**\n\nI think the Cubs are gonna need a new CF since if they plan to be super aggressive for Ohtani, Bellinger is likely not coming back. Straw can be a solid option as either a starting CF for his defense or he can just be their 4th OF and defensive replacement, which he fits well there. Kohl Franklin is a guy with a lot of velocity but some control issues, and we have been known to be able to fix young guys. He could be potentially a starter one day but probably a decent setup guy/middle relief option.\n\n**Shane Bieber traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Anthony Santander and Bryan Baker**\n\nOkay, I think anyone who has been a fan of Cleveland baseball for the last century already knows that Bieber is gone. We've done this with every solid starter we have ever had, and it's just how we do things. I think especially after their playoff showing, Baltimore is going to be very into the SP market. 3 spots in their rotation I think are locked but after that their remains uncertainty, and with the amazing offense they have and many OF prospects on the way up, such as Cowser, they no longer need Santander, who can fill in for us perfectly as a RF power hitter and possibly some 1B if Manzardo is not ready to start off the season. Bryan Baker is a throw in as Baltimore needs more room for their 40 man roster crunch coming up.\n\n**Tyler Freeman traded to the Miami Marlins for Kemp Alderman**\n\nThe Marlins are in severe need of a guy like Freeman, who can start at SS for them on opening day if that so choose. Freeman is a luxury that I don't believe the Guardians need. He's a solid player, but in my opinion, there is nothing Freeman can do that Rocchio can't. Arias is a better option for power, and Rocchio is a better option in pretty much every other way as long as he can get a solid sense on the base paths. Kemp is a solid OF prospect with really good pop, which is what we're gonna need in the future. \n\n**The Roster**\n\nWhen all of that is said and done, the 26 man roster will in my opinion look something like this. \n\nC: Naylor/Bethancourt/Fry\n\n1B: Naylor/Manzardo\n\n2B: Gimenez\n\nSS: Arias/Rocchio\n\n3B: Ramirez\n\nLF: Kwan\n\nCF: Brennan/Laureano\n\nRF: Santander\n\nSP: McKenzie, Williams, Allen, Bibee, Quantril\n\nRP: Morgan, Hentges, Lauer, De Los Santos, Stephan, Karinchak, Lopez\n\nCL: Clase\n\nLineup:\n\n1. Kwan LF\n2. Ramirez 3B\n3. Naylor DH\n4. Santander RF\n5. Manzardo 1B\n6. Gimenez 2B\n7. Arias/Rocchio SS\n8. Naylor C\n9. Brennan/Laureano\n\nI think this lineup gives us solid power upside as well as consistency at the top of it. Hopefully gone are the days of cleanup bats like Calhoun, Gonzalez, and Laureano. This with a rotation that is young and developing and I think we can compete for the division and hopefully get to the ALDS and put up a fight. \n\nSome other notes: Oscar Gonzalez probably get's DFA'd in this scenario. I've been a huge Spongebob fan since day 1, but with Valera and DeLauter on the way soon, he just does not have a place on this roster IMO. I think Fry has ore value since he can also be a backup catcher and plays a fine RF or 1B in the scenario that they leave Manzardo in the minors. \n\n**TL;DR Trade Bieber for a power RF, get Straw outta here, sign some solid bullpen help including 1 LHP, and trade Freeman to add some decent prospects back.** \n\n**This is once again just my opinion, if you think I'm an idiot or smart, feel free to discuss it. I felt the trades were pretty fair and the FA moves make sense, but if you disagree, you disagree.

I have arbitrarily picked 6 as the number of games I wish to talk about but am open to expanding the list beyond that should your suggestions deserve inclusion in the discussion.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'd be interested in hearing about games that aren't all action and adventure and possibly take a more nuanced look at what it means to be a pirate - less of the seafaring Robin Hoods and privateers hampering the dastardly \\[insert hostile nation name here\\] and more of a look at the mundane day to day (not ideal for a game I know), the politics, the impact on local populations, and the victims of pirates. I get that these may not be high on the gameplay designer's wishlist as subjects to tackle but I'm keen to hear about any games that did try to take on this fight. I would also be keen to hear about games that focused on modern piracy instead of the age of sail stuff if anyone knows of some.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway here are my 6...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) **Treasure Island (C64, ZX Spectrum, C16/Plus4)**\n\nThe first video game that attempted to work with the plot of Treasure Island (instead of simply leveraging recognition from the title alone) and understood the significance of the island in that story. While there are liberties taken with the original text the adventure feels grounded in the sanitised fairy tale/boys own version of what it is to be a pirate. Also... it's one of my first computer games so I would have included it for that reason alone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**2) Sid Meier's Pirates! (as a series... far too many formats to list)**\n\nA broader look at pirates and a great attempt at bringing a variety of gameplay elements to the table. Skillfully mixing sword fights, resource management, political relationships, naval navigation and sea battles, exploration, and fun into a game that I have always considered to be the pinnacle of video game piratical entertainment. A game with an end goal that also lent itself to being a sandbox for messing around. SM's Pirates really was well ahead of its time when first released and each subsequent iteration/remake has introduced and evolved just enough to allow Pirates! to consistently find an audience at the time of its release... it's just a shame I can't see another on the horizon.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**3) Monkey Island (as a series... another with far too many formats to list)**\n\nA series of point and click games that lampoons the world of pirates through insult-powered swordplay, featuring some obscure puzzles, and liberally peppered with laugh out loud comedy moments. What the Monkey Island games did that others had failed to up to this point was to attempt to subvert our expectations of the world of pirates and reframe them in a way that scored points for comedic effect and allowed us to question their portrayal and, occasionally, society in general. The lightning in a bottle was so potent it went a long way to extending the shelf life of the P&amp;C genre. Some 30 years since it first weighed anchor and sailed onto our computers the games are still being returned to, in either their original or remake form, by generations of gamers.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**4) Skies of Arcadia (Dreamcast, Gamecube)**\n\nFlying ships and sky pirates, first seen in the literature of Jules Verne (*Robur the Conqueror*), a concept revisited and popularised at the end of Disney's Peter Pan, and over the years found in everything from books and films, to mangas and games... games like Skies of Arcadia. Sega's sky pirate RPG masterpiece shuns the dungeons and dragons fantasy world of it's genre brethren and instead goes big on science fiction and pirates. Transposing pirate themes into it's sci-fi setting allows SoA to feel familiar and fresh at the same time. With battles taking a turn based approach and being split into traditional RPG team affairs and an altogether more interesting ship battle mode which shuns the traditional pirate game action based battles for another turn based system. SoA, along with media such as Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter novels, Star Wars (think Jabba's Sail Barge), and Disney's Treasure Planet, demonstrated a desire, and means, of keeping the age of sail aspects of the golden age of Piracy relevant in a science fiction setting that would typically seem ill-suited to them. SoA played with the idea of the sky as an ocean and as President John F Kennedy once said \"Space is the new ocean\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**5) Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag (PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, Nintendo Switch, PC)**\n\nBreathing fresh briney air into a franchise that was offering generally diminishing returns from ACII onwards Black Flag brought the kind of open-world freedom that a romantic image of piracy paints to games. Pirates are often portrayed as anti-hero explorers sailing the seven seas and Black Flag delivered on this in a way that encouraged exploration in its players. Granted the improvements were built upon the limited seafaring elements of ACIII but the implementation and mechanics allowed it the rise high above its predecessor. Black Flag, just like Sid Meier's Pirates, also features nods to, and cameos of real pirates (although liberally splashed with the finest Artistic Licence eau de parfum) to help with its world building.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**6) Sea of Thieves (Xbox One, Xbox Series, PC)**\n\nThe latest big Pirate adventure comes from Rare in the form of Sea of Thieves. What Sea of Thieves does is take all that players have come to love about action orientated pirate games and opens that up to a shared experience. No longer are players assuming the role of captain while AI pirate goons do the donkey work as SoT allows a group of friends to form a crew, sail the sea and share the spoils of their bucaneering adventures. Maintaining order on real pirate ship would have been no easy task if all onboard were to not pulling in the same direction and the same is true when playing SoT. SoT plays best when crews operate in a cordinated way, the tap of Xbox pad buttons serving as a metaphorical sea shanty as the pirates strive to achieve a common goal. Taking in more fantastical and mystical elements and folding them into a fantasy pirate world has allowed Rare to capture an element of pirate fantasy rarely seen in the video gaming sphere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Honourable mentions:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Treasure Island - A 1981 Data East arcade game that I think may be the first use of the Treasure Island name and possibly the first game about pirates too. I have tried to find games from the second console generation about pirates but have so far come up short - If you can think of any games that predate 1981 then please do let me know.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Games with Pirate elements - Treasure Island Dizzy features themes and elements associated with Pirates but they aren't core to the experience - this game is more of a nod to the existence of pirates instead of being about pirates. Other games that feature piratical theming (in part or across the game) but are not included are Turtles in Time (Pirate ship level), Donkey Kong Country 2 (Pirate Panic), The Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker &amp; Phantom Hourglass (Tetra's Pirate Crew), High Seas Havoc.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Pirate IPs turned into games - Pirates of the Caribbean, any and all flavours of Captain Jack's adventures, have been omitted from this list because the games are a spinoff of the movie franchise (which is in itself a spinoff from the theme park ride) and in all likelihood would never have seen the light of day were it not for the film's success. Other games based on IP licences that have been considered but are not strong enough to warrant inclusion as games in their own right due to their dependence on other media are Hook, Cutthroat Island, Pirates of Dark Water, One Piece. That's not to say that these are bad games but rather that these IPs are better suited to discussion in areas where they have their greatest strength.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nQuick note... I've not included Ubisofts Skull and Bones in the conversation as it's unfair to talk about a game that's yet to release to the public properly. Obviously I will be keeping my eyes fixed on he horizon for its approach but until then... they'll just have to remain as a footnote.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly if you've made it this far... thanks! It was really not meant to be this long but once I started I just wanted to get down some ideas and thoughts for others to work from.

I understand that his career was cut short and he's not going to make it. However, over the past few weeks I've seen so many outlets discuss his candidacy and I truly believe he deserves to get in. There's three particular comps that I want to bring up:\n\nWright vs. Jeter\n\nI saw a comp between Wright and Jeter on instagram comparing their numbers through their age 30 seasons. Wright has a higher WAR, games played, HR, RBI, SLG, OPS, and OPS+ than Jeter. Jeter beats Wright in PA, Hits, SB, AVG, and OBP. Wright was a 7 time all star vs Jeter's 6 in that span. Wright had 2 Gold Gloves vs Jeter's 1 and had 2 Silver Sluggers vs Jeter having none. I don't want to get into the weeds on every stat but for example Wright has 222 home runs vs. Jeter's 150. That's a big difference. Some of the other stats are closer than others but still Wright beats Jeter in a lot of categories. Jeter is a 1st Ballot Hall of Famer and Wright is said as not deserving to get in by most. \n\nWright vs. Beltre\n\nMLB Network had Anthony Recker compare Wright's 9 year peak vs Beltre's. Same exact number of games at 1305. Wright has a higher AVG, OPS, and RBI total. Beltre has a higher HR total and WAR. For reference, Wright has a .302 AVG vs Beltres .290 during that span. Beltre's WAR is 51.5 vs Wright's 44.4 so there's a decent sized gap there. But overall their numbers are very similar. Beltre is said to be a no doubt 1st Ballot Hall of Famer while Wright is said as not deserving to get in by most. \n\nWright vs. Trout\n\nLiterally as I am typing this MLB Now put up a graph with Wright's numbers from the first 10 years of his career. They showcased his AVG, HR total, OBP, OPS, SB, and WAR. The only player in the expansion era that has the same stats or better is Mike Trout. Mike Trout is said by everyone to be a sure fire Hall of Famer despite his recent injury history. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBased on all of this, I can't comprehend the argument that Wright shouldn't get in. The biggest argument is that Wright doesn't have the longevity to make it but I don't think longevity is the be all end all. If a player has 7 elite seasons and is one of the best players in the league then in my mind they deserve to get in. Wright has 9... He has similar numbers to Beltre, better numbers than Jeter in a lot of categories, and is in a stat category that consists of he and Mike Trout. He deserves to get in. If all of the players I mentioned before are Hall of Famers then how is David Wright not a Hall of Famer? We're going to punish him over a back injury that cost him the back end of his career despite the fact that he was an elite player for 9 seasons? That just doesn't sit well with me. \n\nTLDR: David Wright deserves to be in the Hall Of Fame.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": -0.5794}, {"ranking": 0.5689655172413793, "comments": "Mets sign Kyle Crick to minor league deal with invite to ST ", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.1531}, {"ranking": 0.5689655172413793, "comments": "Mets claim Cooper Hummel Can play all 3 OF spots, 1st, 3rd and catcher.

Our main focus should be building a strong deep pitching staff. Diaz going out shouldnt have left us in shambles. We also need a good starting rotation with **young** capable starters that can survive an injury or two. I think for hitting we should just put our money into signing alonso long term. He is one of the strongest hitters in the nl and seems like a great guy. Although we arent in the clubhouse he seems like a good leader along side lindor. One more power bat would be nice however, putting money into pitching staff is more important because of our prospects baty, vientos, mauricio, and alvarez. With 3 of 4 players having a season in the show under their belt they should be able to prove themselves this year as reliable consistent hitters. \n\nWhat does everyone think? Do u agree?

In the past, I\u2019ve billed them as \u201cbargain bin\u201d options, but given the Reds\u2019 expected payroll flexibility and their desire to contend, I\u2019m thinking of this crop of players more as \u201cundervalued FAs who could help the Reds build a contender.\u201d With needs at SP, RP, RHH corner OF, and a backup IF, any bargain that the Reds can find could help them invest more resources at another spot. For example, if the Reds fill their RHH corner OF hole for less than $5M, that might be the difference between being able to acquire a $10M AAV SP vs. acquiring a $20M SP.\n\nWithout further ado, here is this year\u2019s crop of potential values:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRHP Frankie Montas\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 31\n\nYou may remember Montas from the three-team trade that sent Todd Frazier from the Reds to the White Sox, with Montas going to the Dodgers. I, like many, was confused as to why the Reds didn\u2019t just take Montas and the rest of the package that went to the Dodgers, rather than the Jose Peraza-led package that the Reds got from the Dodgers. After a rocky start to his MLB career, Montas has been an excellent SP, with a 3.69 ERA, 3.61 FIP, and 3.79 xFIP since 2018. If he was hitting FA off of a healthy season, he\u2019d probably get a deal worth at least $100M. Alas, he missed almost the entirety of the 2023 season with a shoulder injury, only coming back for a 1.1 IP relief appearance on the last day of September. That said, he had almost all of his velocity back in that appearance, so there\u2019s some reason for optimism about his return to full health with a full offseason of recovery. This is the type of one-year bounceback pitching flier who rarely signs with the Reds, but he could provide a cheaper chance for the Reds to land a playoff-caliber SP this offseason.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRHP Spencer Turnbull\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 31\n\nTurnbull is another bounceback candidate, as he has not been a useful SP since 2021. That\u2019s because he had Tommy John surgery in 2021 and took all of 2022 to recover. He really struggled upon return in 2023, but it came out this week that he was dealing with a foot injury that compromised his ability. Obviously, this means there\u2019s some risk involved, but across 2020-21, Turnbull compiled a 3.46 ERA, 3.24 FIP, and 4.17 xFIP. He is a great fit for GABP, as he has run a well-above-average 49.9% GB% in his career. This proclivity for groundballs makes up for relatively average strikeout and walk numbers. Because of his sour 2023 after missing 2022, Turnbull will likely be a pretty cheap addition, so he presents another cheap option to potentially bolster the rotation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRHP Jakob Junis\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 31\n\nAfter a decidedly subpar first five years of his career with the pitching-averse Royals, Junis joined the Giants in 2022 and had two successful seasons, putting up a 4.18 ERA, 3.69 FIP, and 3.67 xFIP in a hybrid starter/reliever role. Given Nick Krall\u2019s comments that he\u2019d love to find a pitcher who can give the team innings out of either the rotation *or* the bullpen, guys like Junis have to be on our collective radar. Junis blends a low walk rate with average strikeouts and an average amount of groundballs, and this combo makes him just about a slightly-above-average MLB pitcher. There\u2019s nothing flashy or special about that, but teams need average pitchers to help deepen a staff. Think of it this way: Junis isn\u2019t an improvement on, say, Graham Ashcraft, but he sure is an improvement on Luke Weaver. He\u2019s not a guy you want pitching in the playoffs, but he\u2019s certainly a guy who can give you a plenty valuable 120 innings in a swingman role.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRHP Nick Martinez\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 33\n\nMartinez came back from a several year stint in Asia to sign with the Padres in 2022. Much like Junis, he has pitched in a swingman role over the past two seasons, and he has pitched to a 3.45 ERA, 4.17 FIP, and 3.91 xFIP while getting a high-quality 50.6% GB rate, making him another great fit for GABP. Also, even though his strikeout rate (22.1%) has only been in the realm of average, his whiffs (12.3% SwStr%) are that of a guy who should strikeout an above-average amount of batters. Martinez is arguably the ideal fit for the \u201cswingman\u201d role that Krall seems to be advertising, so he\u2019s a name I\u2019d watch.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLHP Scott Alexander\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 34\n\nAs just about everyone knows, the Reds\u2019 bullpen\u2019s number one need is another pitcher who excels at getting left-handed hitters out. On the entirety of the FA market, there is almost no one who gets LHHs out better than Scott Alexander, who has eviscerated LHHs to the tune of a .218/.274/.311 line across his nine-year career. He\u2019s also not hopeless against RHH, who have hit .275/.349/.377 off of him in his career, which isn\u2019t great, but it means he\u2019s not a simple LOOGY either. There\u2019s also one other thing that makes Alexander an elite fit for the Reds: he gets groundballs better than literally anybody else, running an insane 68.4% GB rate in his career, which is the highest of any active pitcher and 2nd out of the 555 pitchers with at least 200 IP since 2015. This has all led to a 3.29 ERA, 3.65 FIP, and 3.59 xFIP for his career, including a 3.26 FIP and 3.78 xFIP in 2023 (albeit with an inflated 4.66 ERA). Despite his career success, Alexander doesn\u2019t make much money. In fact, in his final year of arbitration (which is usually a relatively good approximation for about 80% of what a player can expect to make per year on the FA market), Alexander only pocketed $1.15M. I frankly have no idea why he\u2019s not valued, and I\u2019d love to see the Reds add him to round out their pen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRHP Robert Stephenson\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 31\n\nThat\u2019s right, folks. It\u2019s ya boy BobSteve. After a mightily disappointing stint with the Reds (although let\u2019s not forget that he was quite solid in 2019), Stephenson had a solid year in Colorado in 2021 before struggling in 2022 and ending up on the Pirates. Well, his career outlook changed entirely mid-2023, as he was traded to the Rays. With the Rays, he put up a 2.35 ERA, 2.45 FIP, and 2.26 xFIP in 38.1 IP, with a ridiculous 42.9% K rate and an otherworldly 28.7% SwStr%, which is quite literally one of the highest whiff rates in league history. Was it just a good run, or did he legitimately improve? Well, it\u2019s probably both. The Rays helped him turn his slider into a harder, tighter cutter, taking it from about 85 MPH to 89 MPH, and his cutter pretty much instantly became one of the best pitchers in baseball. He may very well finally be delivering on his high-leverage potential, but his past struggles will likely keep his price tag down just enough that he could be a bargain.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRHP Codi Heuer\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 27\n\nHeuer, who was the secondary piece that returned to the Cubs in the 2021 trade that sent Craig Kimbrel to the White Sox, was just non-tendered by the Cubs after missing both the 2022 and 2023 seasons. He had Tommy John surgery during Spring Training in 2022, and he suffered a fractured elbow in June 2023 while he was pitching on a rehab assignment. The reason that Heuer is worth mentioning here despite missing the past two seasons is that he is plenty talented, and he can likely be had for around $1M. In 91 IP in his first two seasons (2020-21), Heuer had a 3.56 ERA, 3.66 FIP, and 4.19 xFIP, with a solid 45.1% GB rate. Heuer also gets great whiffs (13.7% SwStr%) that indicate further strikeout upside, given that he has run a rather pedestrian 21.7% K rate in his career. (As a side note, last year, I crafted a stat called expected K% for pitchers, based on SwStr% and CSW%, and Heuer\u2019s xK% was 25.8%, which would be a major improvement). Unlike most on this list, Heuer is a true flier, and the investment would be low, but I think the payoff could be impressive. The last thing that makes him interesting is that he has minor league options remaining, so he can be stashed in the minors and increases overall roster flexibility.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOF Aaron Hicks\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 34\n\n\u00b7 **Bats:** Switch; **Throws:** Right\n\nAfter his once-promising tenure with the Yankees fizzled out to an ignominious end, Hicks had a fantastic rebound in the second half of 2023 with the Orioles, putting up a .275/.381/.425 slash line, good for a 129 wRC+. Now, with an aging body and a truly dreadful 2021 \u2013 early 2023 stretch, it\u2019s highly unlikely that Hicks will be as good going forward as he was with the Orioles. But that\u2019s okay, because the Reds don\u2019t need him to be. They just need him to fill the very specific role of a lefty-mashing OF, and Hicks put up an incredible 173 wRC+ against LHP in 2023. That number is obviously not sustainable, but Hicks has been an above-average bat against LHP throughout his entire career (108 wRC+), including a quite good 118 wRC+ since his breakout 2017 with the Yankees. Also, even when he\u2019s not getting results, Hicks is known for having fantastic plate discipline (career 12.7% BB), so he really deepens a lineups\u2019 ability to run up pitchers\u2019 pitch counts. Though he\u2019s neither the athlete nor defender that he was in the past, Hicks has experience in all three OF spots, which is something this Reds roster could really use. Despite his positive run with the Orioles, Hicks should not cost more than a few million dollars in 2024.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOF Robbie Grossman\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 34\n\n\u00b7 **Bats:** Switch; **Throws:** Left\n\nGrossman is the quintessential short-side platoon OF, and he\u2019s actually similar to Hicks in many ways, but with even more drastic splits, as he has a career 126 wRC+ against LHP, compared to 94 against RHP. He walks a bunch (career 12.9% BB). The one thing that is a major negative for Grossman is that he is a decidedly below-average fielder, and he is limited to the corners. Thus, his role on the Reds would be pretty small, but he would deepen the Reds\u2019 lineup against LHP, which they desperately need. His 2022 was worse than his 2023, but he had to settle for only a $2M deal last offseason, so I\u2019d imagine he only gets about $3-5M this year. Count me in at that number.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIF Gio Urshela\n\n\u00b7 **Age:** 32\n\n\u00b7 **Bats:** Right; **Throws:** Right\n\nIf the Reds trade Jonathan India, they really could use another RHH who can play on the dirt. I know that feels weird to say given that the idea behind trading India is that they have too many IF, but with Nick Senzel gone, the Reds\u2019 backup IF options are decidedly slim at this juncture (it\u2019s pretty much just Jose Barrero). Thus, *if* India is traded (I\u2019m assuming he will be), it feels like a lock that the Reds will add another MLB infielder somewhere. Urshela is the middle ground between the rumored interest in Jeimer Candelario and the signing of a true backup. Projected to make about $10M per year over a couple of years, Urshela is a slightly above-average hitter (106 wRC+ since 2021) who can play a solid 3B and 1B regularly and can fill in in the middle infield in a pinch. Urshela doesn\u2019t have massive splits, but he has been better throughout his career against LHP (109 wRC+) than he has been against RHP (101 wRC+), including a 119 wRC+ against LHP since 2021. In all, Urshela has a pretty well-rounded skillset, albeit a boring one. Think of it this way: for a pretty modest monetary outlay, the Reds could replace India with a more versatile player (increasing roster flexibility) while also getting the trade return that they can get for trading India.", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9996}, {"ranking": 0.22413793103448276, "comments": "Autographed baseball I have a ball I got in 2012 when I was a kid in spring training signed by J Bruce, JV, BP, Drew Stubbs, Griffey senior and a few other players who I can\u2019t identify.

The more and more I think about the possibility of India being traded, the worse I feel about the idea. We all know what he does for the team in the clubhouse, and that is definitely worth considering, but the other thing we have to remember is that we have a DH now. The infield is not as log-jammed as it might first appear, *ESPECIALLY if the fastest player in the league starts manning centerfield for us!* Keeping India and moving Elly De La Cruz means we have an infield of:\n\n* CES - 1B/DH\n* Steer - 3B/DH\n* Marte - SS/3B/DH\n* McLain - SS/2B\n* India - 2B/DH\n\nAll of the positions are easily covered and our DH can come from one of our infielders in 90%+ of our games.\n\nIf Elly can pull a Billy Hamilton, we are instantly better both offensively and defensively in the outfield. If India is traded, I feel this option no longer becomes viable. Imagine that stacked infield (providing the rookies keep their production up) with an outfield of EDC and Friedl, Fraley and Benson platooning the corners. Throw Stephenson behind the plate and man... What a high ceiling lineup they've got!\n\nMy last argument would be that if our pitching is healthy (big ask, I know), we go through '24 with a rotation of Greene, Lodolo, Abbott, Ashcraft and Williamson. We have a bullpen that is *OK* and hopefully can be bolstered through free agency. So then we're left to ask, what do we even *want* out of an India trade? Sure, prospects can be OK. And some pitching depth through trade is fine too. But there is no big need. I cant figure out how trading India doesn't ONLY make us worse? It makes our infield worse. It makes our DH worse. It makes our outfield worse. And you might even argue that it makes our pitching worse as we spend more resources trying to correct those other areas.\n\nAgain, if the offers coming in are absolutely insane, then sure.

Anybody see any other interesting candidates?", "date": "20231118", "sentiment": 0.9356}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Offseason aquisition Write Up Under the assumption we lose stanek, maton, neris, Brantley, maldy and that france, urquidy, kess, singleton, and Meyers are all players that could be traded this offseason it leaves us with a total of 9 roster spots to fill and according to fan graphs \\~5m to do it if we are to stay under the luxury tax like crane would want. \n\nSP: The team likely needs to work in a six man rotation with Verlanders age, mccullers injuries, browns health, Garcia\u2019s recovery, and framer/javiers inconsistency this past season. \n\nS1: Verlander\n\nS2: valdez\n\nS3: javier\n\nS4:brown\n\nS5: Turnbull/Urquidy \n\nS6/bullpen 5: ***Whitley/arrighetti***\n\nIt has been said that we shouldn\u2019t expect LMJ and Garcia until after the all star break. This means we have At least one rotation spot open if we want to roll with a five man to start the season or two if we want to start the season with a six man rotation. When we have all of them back though it would make the most sense to have a six man rotation (especially if we can\u2019t count on lances health). Thus we seem to be in need of a player that can be a decent 4/5 starter but also an solid bullpen piece/solid long reliever. \n\nOption 1: Urquidy - frankly urquidy\u2019s best quality is that he is already on the roster and wouldn\u2019t take anything to acquire. Urquidy only had a fip under 4 once during his rookie season. This year saw him walk way more batters which had been one of his greatest attributes, though he did increase his chase rate. The bigger issue is that urquidy is not a great reliever. Granted 2023 was the first time he had spent significant time in the bullpen he did not preform. He had a OPS against of .808 and an ERA of 6.06 while coming out of the pen. \n\nOption 2: Soroka - Soroka had an incredible 2019 before his career was quickly derailed by injuries. The few times he has made it to the mound for the braves since, he has been a bad pitcher. When he was on in 2019 though he had an incredible 3 pitch mix featuring a sinker/slider/changeup. He was elite at slowing down RHB holding them to a .537OPS against and the future only looked bright from there. He still held left handers to a respectable for a starter .750 OPS. This was also all done in 2019, the year of the juiced ball. He never was a huge strike out guy but he kept the ball on the ground being in the 89th percentile of GB% and he made sure to limit walks to prevent runners from getting on base. Since coming back from injury he has been a little more wild though and more prone to walks. He will be 26 next season and still has plenty of room to grow but his lack of contribution in 4 seasons has made him a possible non tender candidate or a player to target in a cheap trade. Add to this dana\u2019s background with the braves and this seems like it could be a no brainer add. As I was writing this up soroka got traded disappointed Dana didn\u2019t pull the trigger on this.\n\nOption 3: Forrest Whitley- Most here know his story. Middle of the first round draft pick out of San Antonio who became a top 25 prospect in the game and then proceeded to not pitch for 2 seasons and battled injuries over his past two seasons. He is now 26 years old and essentially in his make or break season as I believe he is out of options unless we successfully petition for more due to medical reasons. Right off the bat the thing that made people fall in love with Whitley was his pitches. His fastball, curveball, and changeup graded out at a 60 and his slider and cutter graded out at a 55 meaning he was viewed as throwing all plus pitches. So here\u2019s the reason to remain positive. His 2023 stats in sugar land. His ERA wasn\u2019t pretty but he held his opponents to a .205 BAA and got about 1.52 GO/AO ratio. A ratio similar to hunter brown who was considered a good ground ball pitcher during his time in sugar land. More importantly Forrest held RHB to a .582 OPS in the pacific division which is nothing to overlook (notably his BAA and his OPS against for RHB is better than arrighetti). Forrests body may never allow him to be a starter but I firmly believe that he has the capabilities to be a high leverage reliever.\n\nOption 4: JP France - Hard to say he belongs in our rotation as contenders. Maybe someone else wants to take a shot on him or maybe he becomes a spot starter for us. JP had an ERA over 5 in the final two months of the season as batters were teeing off with nearly a 130 ops+ too. His xERA was 5.00 and his xBA was in the bottom 17th percentile. It certainly seemed like he finally got figured out and at 29 (age at the beginning of next season) it is hard to see growth forward from what he showed. Certainly not the worst option to have he could well be a good option to start the season as a sixth man in the rotation. The issues that I pointed out are issues that other teams will see so while he may have some trade value it is hard to imagine it being a lot. It certainly feels like a harsh decision to not have him make the roster after what he contributed to the team in 2023 but it may well happen\n\nOption 5: Spencer Arrighetti - Spencer is considered one of the few bright things in our farm system. He has a good fastball/slider mix, a decent curveball, and changeup that has improved as he has moved through the system. He could absolutely fit into the back of our rotation but I would probably try it soroka at first and let arrighetti start in sugar land. If soroka sucks in the spring or gets hurt during the year I would pivot to arrighetti. \n\nOption 6: Edward Cabrera - Cabrera is out of options with the marlins which have lead to speculation that he will finally be dealt as he seems to be on the outside looking in of their pitching rotation. At 25 Cabrera is a player that has yet to put it all together. His OPS vs RHB is .822 while against LHB it is .586. Part of the problem is that he is incredibly wild and in the bottom 1% of walks% in the mlb. The hope comes from the rest of the numbers Cabrera puts up. A 55.7 GB%, .196 xBA, an average launch angle of 7.6, and he is in the 78th percentile for limiting avg exit veto. All of this is impressive plus his 27 K% that shows he is not just a ground ball pitcher. Batters hit .186 against Cabrera\u2019s changeup (making him so good against lefties). While batters actually hit .240 against his curveball his xBA was .181. He also has put up good marks with his fourseamer that batters are hitting .214 agains and his slider that batters are hitting .222 against. The problem with Cabrera would likely be a high acquisition cost because the player has yet to even make it to arb (in part because he has spent time in the minors every year he has also been in the majors, this is why the out of options is such a big deal)\n\nOption 7: Spencer Turnbull - is able to generate a lot of above average movement on all of his pitches. He has been in the middle of a disagreement with the tigers about his usage which will lead to him being DFA\u2019d. In 2021 in 9 starts turnbull was great with a 3.01 xERA and a .206 xBAA while generating a 58 GB%. He hasn\u2019t pitched over 100 innings in 4 seasons meaning he may not be a great candidate to stick it out in the rotation long term but he could well be a great candidate to play until July and hold down the fort. If he does well enough we could even flip him in a contender/contender trade if he throws a fit about losing his spot in the rotation. \n\nOther considerations: woodruff( for one season if he is non tendered)\n\nCloser: Pressly\n\nSet Up: Abreu\n\nSet Up: Graveman\n\nBullpen 1: Montero\n\nNot much can really be done here. Graveman is going to have to step up to be the high leverage guy we traded for. Montero is going to need to be better since we are paying him 10 reliever money. The hope is at least partially there as he seemed to figure It out a little in July/august over about 20 innings where batters only had a low .600 OPS against before struggling again in September. We are going to need him to certainly be more consistent. Graveman is a little more concerning. He rocked a 2.42 ERA in Houston but a 5.00 FIP is certainly cause for a bit of concern.\n\nBullpen 2: Dillon Maples/ Morejon\n\nBullpen 3: Codi Heuer/ Nabil Crismatt\n\nBullpen 4: Chris Stratton\n\nOption 1: Chris Stratton - Stratton has some good pitches but hasn\u2019t ever quite put it together. He generates a strong amount of horizontal movement on his offspeed pitches and he generates great spin rates on his curveball and his fastball. He got a decent amount of chases on his pitches while with the pirates before joining the cardinals and then rangers. 2023 represented one of his better years by xERA in part due to the raised launched angle on his pitches. He lowered his BAA and his OBP at the cost of his SLG going back up. He has historically been better against RHB but in 2023 he actually did quite well against LHB with a .590 OPS against(with about half the ABs) but a still respectable .679 OPS against vs RHB. He was unimpressive in the the playoffs and he is a respectable reliever that will likely command a decent salary. \n\nOption 2: Diego castillo- Castillo is a weird one. He was an elite reliever earlier in his career but his fastball veto has slowly declined and so has he. He was still a serviceable reliever in 2022 but 2023 saw him get DFA\u2019d so the M\u2019s could make room for their prospects. Despite his declining velocity he was on an upward trajectory as he continued to build better expected stats. 2022 was a bit of a down year and then the wheels completely fell off the bus in 2023. He still was limiting opposing batter to a low xBA and getting a lot of groundballs like he has been known for. Castillo was someone who thrived in what baseball reference would consider high leverage situations posting a .500 OPS against. In 2022 Castillo showed an above average ability to prevent inherited runners from scoring. Castillo had been a sinker/slider pitcher for most of his career but in 2023 he tried to add a change-up to his mix adding a third pitch, but it wasn\u2019t really seen because he didn\u2019t pitch enough this year.\n\nOption 3: Nabil Crismatt - Crismatt isn\u2019t someone I would guarantee a spot on the major league roster but he is certainly would be an interesting player to give a minor league contract with a major league spring training invite too. Crismatt pitched at his best for the padres before being dfa\u2019d, picked up by the dbacks and then electing free agency at the end of the year. In over 60 innings in 2022 crismatt sported a .616 OPS vs LHB and a .673 OPS vs RHB. At just 28 years old crismatt offers to be one of the younger options on the market. Crismatt was at his worst in high leverage situations allowing a .728 OPS against and a poor ability to prevent the few inherited runs he was trusted with from scoring. As far as his pitch mix goes Crismatt has a strong change up with an ok curve. He recently added a slider to his mix too. His problem is that he has no average fastball. He averages about 89/90 mph on his fastball. This is slightly misleading because of his great extension releasing the ball ups his perceived velocity by about 1 mph. The reason that Crismatt\u2019s low velocity might work in his favor is in order to replace maton. Having a reliever coming out of the pen that isn\u2019t just throwing gas may be more valuable than adding another flame thrower. Secondly in Crismatt\u2019s favor is his GB% which has been at about 50% for his career. He does a decent job limiting hard contact. The active spin rate on his curve ball is one of the highest in baseball. He had one of the 15 best changeups in baseball in 2022. \n\nOption 4: Codi Heuer - Heuer is\u2026 interesting to say the least. He underwent Tommy John in 2022 and then while working his way back in 2023, he suffered a fractured elbow. The fact that heuer hasn\u2019t pitched since 2021 makes him a likely trade candidate/non-tender candidate for a cubs team that can\u2019t pencil in a player that hasn\u2019t played in 3 years into their bullpen. But to be fair neither can we. So onto what heuer was able to do in 2021. Heuer started the season in the south side of Chicago with an unimpressive ERA north of 5 but a fip at 3.69. After being traded to the cubs heuer posted a 3.14 ERA but a 4.36 FIP. Heuer throws about 97mph on his fastball and his extension brings his perceived velocity to about 98/99 mph. He found himself in the 82nd percentile for the spin rate. His fastball also has 7 inches of horisontal movement above average (second best in baseball). Despite this his fastball got hit hard to the tune of a .336 BA. Instead his offspeed and breaking pitches are where he made his money. Hitters hit .151 against his slider and .170 against his changeup. He also showed a good ability to prevent inherited runners from scoring allowing a below league average 8/36 (for context maton let 30/38 score this past year). Having not pitched in two seasons and coming off an elbow fracture, heuer is certainly a wild card. Even more scarily he posted a 7.82 ERA in AAA before going back down with injury in only 12 innings. Heuer is certainly at his best in high leverage situations though posting an OPS about .120 lower than in medium leverage situations (in more ABs mind you so it isn\u2019t small sample size). He is still young and only has two years in the majors of experience. Heuer could be a great option as an arm to throw gas out of the pen, but maybe it is best for him to start on a minor league deal (assuming he gets non tendered).\n\nOption 5: Dillon Maples - Apparently I have an affinity for cubs pitchers that haven\u2019t pitched in the majors since 2021. Look I know maples isn\u2019t the sexy pick but I honestly believe in what he was in 2021. Maples signed a minor league deal with the Phils in 2022 and then had shoulder surgery that ultimately lead to him not having a team in 2023 and coaching a college team. Let\u2019s start with maples splits in 2021 RHB had a .642 OPS against maples but LHB had an incredible .486 OPS against him. RHB hit .190 and had a .328 SLG against him while LHB hit .087 against maples with a .109 SLG against maples. This highlights the main problem with maples. He doesn\u2019t know where the ball is going when it leaves his hand half the time which culminates in a lot of walks. Here is the other thing with maples: he worked almost exclusively in low leverage innings for the cubs. So on to maples upside. Maples did an incredible job of limiting the speed at which the ball left his opponents bats as well as generating a lot of GB(51.5%). Maples is about average when it comes to his extension which leads to his perceived velocity and his actual velocity both hovering around 96 MPH. Batters hit .167 against his fastball though xBA suggests he over-reformed in this respect. Maples in fact has the fourth highest spin rate on his fastball but only about 52% (2nd worst in the MLB) of it gets translated to active spin. His slider and especially his curve truly shines though. Batters only hit .093 against his slider (a number relatively backed up by xBA) he is again in the top 20 of players generating spin on his slider but again this only translated to about 53% active spin (above average for a slider granted). Finally there is maples curveball that batters hit .143 against a mark that xBA(.058) suggest was extremely lucky. Again here we find maples at 4th on the leaderboards for spin on his curveball. His active spin is again only at 80% a number that is still above average for a curve. In 2021 Maples had the single most Horizontal break (10.3 inches above average) on a slider in the entire MLB, his vertical break on his slider was a still respectable(3.2 inches above average). He sported a pressly-esque curveball with 6.4 inches of vertical break above average and 6.2 inches of horizontal break above average (pressly was at 4.2V/7H). Maples hasn\u2019t been in any org in about a year and a half so just starting him out on a minor league contract with a spring training invite is probably the starting ground. Letting josh miller get his hands on these beautiful pitches and molding them (especially his fastball which is by far his least impressive pitch) could easily make maples an under the radar player for us. The Astros have taken plenty of chances on players that have had struggle with control before, maples I believe could be the next. \n\nOption 6: \n\nOther considerations: Josh Staumont (neck injury with an unknown return timeline), Shintaro Fujinami (he has all the physical attributes but wasn\u2019t able to put them all together), Jorge Alcala (yes the one from the pressly trade. Has a good slider.), Tim Hill (strong lefty out of the pen), Adri\u00e1n Morej\u00f3n (former top prospect that has some decent movement on his pitches but has never put it together), incumbents: seth Martinez (great at preventing inherited runners from scoring), Ortega (a bit of a wild card coming off of injury)\n\nC:Diaz\n\n1B: Abreu - no other real choice here\n\n2B: Altuve\n\nSS - Pena\n\n3B - Bregman\n\nLF: I\u2019d love morel or Kepler.\n\nCF: McCormick\n\nRF: Tucker \n\nDH: Yordan\n\nUTIL1: Dubon\n\nUTIL: ***Tellez***\n\nUTIL: Kessinger\n\nBack up C: ***Hedges***\n\nLF Option 1: Christopher Morel - High Prospect value, low $$ value. Rumor has it that the cubs may move on from morel due to his lack of a defensive home. If this does indeed happen we should absolutely jump on this opportunity. Morel is a high strike out player but he absolutely mashes the baseball when he gets a hold of it. He actually was in the 99th percentile for arm strength and the 81st percentile for sprint speed showing that his problem is not a lack of athleticism but more so a lack of knowledge of the position. Sticking Morel in left with petis help should help mitigate the defensive issues he has and make him an ideal LF bat. Morel had a 116 OPS+ on the season and his avg exit veto was in the 91st percentile. The ball absolutely jumps off his bat and he is a great threat on the base paths. He will likely be expensive because he has a lot of years of control yet (hasn\u2019t even made it to arb) but we also could be buying low while his defense is holding him back. \n\nLF Option 2: Max Kepler: Firstly the marketing would be great due to him sharing a last name with a famous astrologer. Kepler was a pick I made for us to target last season instead of bringing back Brantley and after having a really down start to the season he finally put it all together and broke out. If you look at Keplers stat cast page he is an above average hitter by every stat cast metric while also being an elite defender in right field. Kepler also offers another left handed bat to add to our line up. A year from FA, the twins may try and capitalize off a great year and get value back before he leaves for nothing. Kepler would certainly be a great add with a 121 OPS+ this year. Notable Kepler\u2019s xBA was a .269, his xwOBA was a .363 and his xSLG was a .499 all values that relatively mirrored his actual production. Kepler would probably be the high $$ but lower prospect cost due to this being his last year under contract. \n\nOther consideration: Soler (high $$), Tommy Pham (low $$, problematic in the clubhouse?), Gurriel frankly seems like a landmine. \n\nBack-up Catcher 1: Austin Hedges - What people seemed to think maldy is. He is really bad at hitting but he is absolutely incredible at other aspects of the game. His framing is elite (something that yainer receives poor marks for) as well as his blocking. His ability to cut down runners is only average though. Hedges is known as well for doing extensive research before his game to call great games. \n\nBack-up Catcher 2: Maldy - The club house loves him but we know what he is. His defensive game is fading, his offensive game was not impressive. The worry with maldy coming back would be that if pitchers were to request him then all of the sudden we are back to maldy starting way to many games a season with poor defensive value. \n\nOther consideration: tucker Barnhart, Gary Sanchez\n\nBench Bat 1: Rowdy Tellez - with dubon and Kessinger both being right handed bats a LHB off the bench seems important. Tellez is likely to be non tendered due to his poor 2023 with the brewers. The near .100 decline in SLG is what truly killed him. The ball just wasn\u2019t jumping off his bat like it was in 2022. The hope here would be that Tellez could provide LH pop off the bench even if it comes at the expense of Ks. Tellez would be strictly a DH/1B with kess covering the rest of the infield and dubon/new LF covering the rest of the outfield. Also with urquidy not a lock to make the roster in 2023 adding a player from the Mexican WBC team might be good PR for our game down there.  \n\nBench Bat 2: Keston Hiura - look I know this one is crazy considering he got DFA\u2019d by the brewers and recently elected FA but the crux of the Hiura argument rests on really one number. Hiura had a 143 wRC+ against RHP in 2022. This was a .866 OPS against RHB but the brewers still allowed him to get 109 PAs against LHP compared to his only 157 PAs against RHP. A) if hiura is put into an extremely aggressive platoon I back him to actually be an above league average hitter (see Brandon belt). B) hiura was seen as being a great contact hitter in the minors before the brewers started to tinker with his swing for more power. Creating a better contact approach at the plate may again help. A minor league deal with a spring training invite should at minimum be on the table. The bigger problem with hiura would be strongly skewing our bench towards RHBs. Something that could maybe be fixed by calling into question kessingers spot on the bench.\n\nOther names in consideration: Jared Walsh (will he ever be the same after shoulder surgery), Nicky Lopez (if we wanted to replace kess with a LHB)\n\nOthers considered: nicky Lopez, Jared Walsh", "date": "20231117", "sentiment": 0.9998}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Jon Morosi (@jonmorosi) on X: \u201cSources: Astros have discussed OF Jake Meyers in trade talks with multiple teams in recent weeks.

We have very little room to do much this offseason without first offloading some $$, which got me wondering where we could find that $$. Pressly is contributing $15m to the luxury tax this year, with Fangraphs valuing him at $10.9m in 2022 and $8.5m in 2023.\n\nTrading him would be a pretty significant payroll savings and could allow some room to fill a Michael Brantley sized hole in LF. Edit: I dont necessarily mean replacing brantley entirely. More so looking for another serviceable bat to split time in LF, as I think Chas should be the everyday CF.\n\nWe would lose one of our top back-end bullpen arms. However, Abreu has shown himself to be more than capable of taking over closer duties. Also, it is much easier and cheaper to assess and fill bullpen needs mid-season via trades than it is to try to trade for another bat. We've got plenty of tradeable guys that would fetch some decent arms to fill out the bullpen.\n\nObviously, you\u2019d need a team interested in taking Pressly. My first thought would be the Orioles. Bautista is likely out until 2025, and Pressly has a mutual option in 2025 so he fills the 1-year need the orioles might have.", "date": "20231114", "sentiment": 0.944}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "[McTaggart} Astros have scheduled an 11 a.m. news conference Monday at Minute Maid Park with GM Dana Brown.

He was then hired by the dodgers as their minor league fielding coordinator before finally settling into their first base coach job where he is now. He won two championships and one manager of the year award while managing the blue jays class A team. McCullough supposedly helped engineer the dodgers to becoming a better base running team through hours of studying tape that has earned him the label of having a strong attention to detail. McCullough left the blue jays with glowing reviews saying that the sky would be the limit for him.\n\nClayton McCullough - the Cons: McCullough played three years professionally after his draft year before hanging it up, never making it to the major league level. Depending on how much you value experience playing the game (with espada not having a lot of experience in this respect) this could be a massive con. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nKai Correa - the Pros: Correa has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top of baseball that ended with him managing the giants last three games this season after Kapler was fired. Correa\u2019s family is made up of some of the greatest Hawaiian baseball coaches. He is lauded for his coaching style that makes it easy for players to understand and learn. Something that was reflected in his ability to turn around two college baseball programs defensive woes. He is forward thinking analytically and has served as a coach for both the guardians and the giants. He spent 4 years as bench coach with the giants\n\nKai Correa - the Cons: Correa would be immediately younger than JV and Jose Abreu and only a few months older than pressly. Having a bench coach 5 years younger than his 40+ year old pitcher may be a bit of odd in the clubhouse. He never played even in the minor league level which may be of concern if you want someone with game experience to balance out espada. He also only spent 4 years at the major league level all as a bench coach but that may be a bigger testament to the belief others have in him. His position with the giants has been filled, but his status with them is still unclear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWillie Harris - the Pros: Harris played for over a decade before hanging them up and getting into the coaching game. He worked in the giants minor league system and coached a little for the reds before ending up as the cubs third base coach in 2020. Harris became known for his unique way of telling runners to get down by himself lying on the ground getting eye to eye with his players. This style is supposedly loved by his players as is he. He is described as a loose and fun character in the club house. \n\nWillie Harris - the Cons: Game 4 of 2005. On a serious note Harris has only coached in the majors since 2021 which gives him the least amount of time in the majors in that respect. I don't really see many other cons to harris outside of him coming from being under ross' staff. That said he could be a good vibes guy and major league experience to balance out espada.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTony Mansolino - the pros: Mansolino has worked in the Indians system, before being brought in to be the Orioles third base coach. His work under Hyde and Tito make him intriguing but I haven\u2019t found much about him past who his bosses are. His dad was our 3b coach during the \u201905 world series before leaving the org in 2007. His father now works for the braves where dana would likely know him from.\n\nTony Mansolino - the cons: At 41 and only having been a major league coach since 2020, mansolino\u2019s coaching career is also a little green in the major league department. He is also only a year older than verlander which may have an odd dynamic in the clubhouse. He also never ascended to the MLB during the six years he spent in the minors. \n\nOmar Lopez - the Pros - Lopez is an astros lifer and has experience managing. Not only managing but managing altuve on a relatively successful run. He managed a lot of our players in the minors and is said to be well respected in the club house\n\nOmar Lopez - the cons - Lopez never made it to the majors despite playing minor league ball. Lopez is another in house candidate which may create a echo chamber for espada and the astros. Bringing in a fresh voice may help the team continue to improve.\n\n[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/17u0ce4)", "date": "20231113", "sentiment": 0.9982}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Horrible light, but got a pic with Julia ", "date": "20231112", "sentiment": -0.3071}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "New pitcher advance metrics and how the Astros stack up against the rest Yikes \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "date": "20231111", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Was Martin Maldonado really as bad as everyone says he was this season?

Middle of the first round draft pick out of San Antonio who became a top 25 prospect in the game and then proceeded to not pitch for 2 seasons and battled injuries over his past two seasons. He is now 26 years old and essentially in his make or break season as I believe he is out of options unless we successfully petition for more due to medical reasons. Right off the bat the thing that made people fall in love with Whitley was his pitches. His fastball, curveball, and changeup graded out at a 60 and his slider and cutter graded out at a 55 meaning he was viewed as throwing all plus pitches. So here\u2019s the reason to remain positive. His 2023 stats in sugar land. His ERA wasn\u2019t pretty but he held his opponents to a .205 BAA and got about 1.52 GO/AO ratio. A ratio similar to hunter brown who was considered a good ground ball pitcher during his time in sugar land. More importantly Forrest held RHB to a .582 OPS in the pacific division which is nothing to overlook (notably his BAA and his OPS against for RHB is better than arrighetti). His command became a problem but there is certainly reason for hope here.

A package of one of the Yankees\u2019 top outfield prospects \u2014 either Spencer Jones or Everson Pereira \u2014 plus shortstop Oswald Peraza and minor-league righty Chase Hampton should get the deal done for both sides. Of course, the Padres might prefer to have a couple of major-league pitchers such as Clarke Schmidt and Michael King included in the package. Either way, there are the makings of a deal here.\u201d \n\nYankees fans and these writers want to push very underwhelming deals as far as what goes to SD. \n\nWhen Mookie Betts was dealt to dodgers on his last year\u2026he landed them a 3+ war player (Verdugo,) top 50 prospect, and C Connor Wong. \n\nYes the dodgers were able to come to a long term deal with Betts (which likely won\u2019t be case for Soto)\u2026but also in the deal they had to take an albatross contract of a washed up David Price\u2019s latter years. \n\nSo yes the deals currently projected of the Yankees side seems very underwhelming.\n\nA similar comparison would be something like Volpe (3 war player,) neither one of Dominguez &amp; Jones aren\u2019t even top 50 but one would likely have to be included\u2026or one of their already major league ready pitchers in King or Schmidt\u2026king being a lil better but likely more for a back end starter or long relief. \n\nAnd I f you get Volpe\u2026it\u2019s likely to flip him for more pitching not to stay on team.\n\nSeems  the media really wants the Padres to do the Yankees a huge favor in just gifting Soto to them\u2026", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9727}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Meet the Padres new manager, Mike Shildt New interview from the Padres and Donny Boy.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Full text of Xavier Scruggs post on Mike Schildt *(Scruggs wrote a* [*great twitter thread*](https://twitter.com/Xavier_Scruggs/status/1729584064376565926) *on the type of coach Mike Schildt is. Hyped me up, so I thought I would share below... )*\n\nMike Shildt was just recently hired for the manager spot for the San Diego Padres. Now, I know I'm usually quick with the baseball trends, but on this occasion I wanted to take my time before diving into an immediate reaction of the hiring. Reason being, I played for Shildt and I feel like I have a really good sense of who he is not only as a manager but who he is as a person. So I wanted to really dive into why this hire is a game-changer for the Padres. Here are 3 reasons why Mike Shildt is the best thing that could've happened to this franchise:\n\n1. Unparalleled Coaching Wisdom: During my 32 years in baseball, I've had my fair share of coaches, but playing for Shildt was a whole different ballgame. He's not just about the Xs and Os; he's the epitome of a true student and teacher of the game. Shildt's attention to detail is unmatched, not just in strategy but in understanding each player's personality. It's the kind of coaching that goes beyond the field and shapes players holistically.\n2. Integrity in Every Fiber: Shildt's commitment to integrity is a game-changer. He's not just a man of faith, though that's a big part of it. He instills a level of integrity that sets the bar for everyone around him \u2013 players and coaches alike. It's not just about the game; it's about being a better person. And let me tell you, having that kind of influence in the clubhouse is something every team dreams of.\n3. Leadership Redefined: Leadership is more than just a title; it's about trust. Shildt defines leadership by fostering the ultimate level of trust within his team. It's not about going through the motions; it's about intentional purposeful leadership. He doesn't sugarcoat things or play politics. Shildt's only mission is to make everyone around him better, on and off the field.  So, Padres fans, get ready for a new era led by a coach who's not just in it for the game, but for the people.

There\u2019s no way he doesn\u2019t break camp with the team. He can play 3B/SS/2B/RF. Eguy also another year removed from his injury is a super utility guy that has a future in this league. He should contribute a lot more this season.\n\nCatcher - Campy finally showed up and showed he\u2019s a major league starting catcher. I see Sullivan as the main backup. \n\nDH - Manny likely till the all star break.\n\nSP - Darvish, Musgrove, Avila, Waldron, Young pitching acquired.\nBP - Suarez takes over for Hader, we keep promoting young power arms to develop. Wilson takes over the setup role.

Preller can retool the lineup from within with just Merrill and Signing Lee (who we seem to be the only team he wants to go to) \n\nPreller just needs to find some arms teams are willing to part with.

He\u2019s arguably the top pitching free agent. I love the connection to Masa and how Yamamoto prefers to play with another Japanese player. This could actually do wonders for both players (since rumors swirled about how Masa was having some issues integrating into our culture). Yamamoto has ace material and it\u2019d be wonderful to see him atop our rotation for many, many years.\n\nDylan Carlson is currently being destroyed by the St Louis Cardinals. They plopped him in and out of the lineup, never letting him get full time reps. With Walker and Nootbar cemented in the Card OF, they are unlikely to roll Carlson full time again in 2024. He\u2019s being rumored to go to the Yankees or Blue Jays but I think left field in Fenway is a perfect fit. He\u2019s had success at the big league level but has been dealing with some injuries over the past couple years. Guessing he\u2019s healthy now. He\u2019s got the pedigree and tools that make you really want to see him with a full shot. At a minimum, he\u2019s great with the glove and a right handed bat, both of which this lineup needs. Given recent production, he shouldn\u2019t cost much on the trade market and I don\u2019t see STL starting the season with him on the roster in an attempt to get his market up before trading him. He has a team friendly contract so this is a total buy low, huge upside play. Bat him 8th or 9th, no pressure and just let him play (which the Cards refused to do).\n\nTrevor Rogers might be surprisingly hard to land. Going into last season, the Marlins seemed to have a plethora of young pitching talent. Alcantara will be out all 2024, Cabrera (another guy I\u2019d love) is anything but a sure thing and Rogers, now healthy, might be a much needed arm in that rotation. But with Max Meyer coming back and the arrival of Eury Perez in the rotation, maybe the Marlins are open to moving him for big league ready position players.  Huge upside which we saw from his rookie campaign but a terrible sophomore season and injury plagued 2023 make me think they could be okay moving off him for a needed puzzle piece.  He\u2019s got the tools and showed some flashes before the injury that make you think 2022 was an outlier. Big arm, big potential and we\u2019d need him for the back of our rotation, so low risk. Team friendly contract. As for what I\u2019d take to get him, they need an upgrade at Catcher and in the OF. Perhaps a Wong or McGuire + Verdugo gets it done. Red Sox are keeping the catcher seat warm for Teel and could easily piece together a backstop through free agency if it means parting with Wong or McGuire (I even hear the twins are open to moving Vasquez \ud83d\udc40).", "date": "20231125", "sentiment": 0.9946}, {"ranking": 0.3620689655172414, "comments": "The Boston Red Sox have signed Jorge Benitez to a MiLB contract.

It's like people are suggesting all stars that are under team control until 2030 and think that the other team is going to give him up willingly.  I am concerned with the number of people that want Marcelo Mayer traded.\n\nI just want to make it very clear, Mayer hasn't been struggling with AA pitching, it's injury and tough luck. His BABIP in AA Portland was at .228. Usually on ballplayers, .280-.300 is normal luck. It's not like we stuck him up there and he's striking out a third of the time like Downs.\n\nThe big thing that explains his numbers last year was the shoulder injury. He only played for 43 games. They shut him down in early August. He spoke to Rob Bradford on it.\n\n&gt;\u201cI\u2019ll go back to the day it happened,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cIt was May 7, we were playing in High-A in Asheville. I was 3-for-3 and I needed a triple for the cycle. I ended up hitting a ball in the gap. I tried to leg it out for the triple. I ended up stumbling past second base and fell. I didn\u2019t really feel it on impact and then the next day I wake up and can\u2019t lift my shoulder at all. I ended up taking that week off, come back playing a little too soon because the competitor in me wanted to play and didn\u2019t want to rest. So I got used to playing hurt and ever since then it became a cycle and never really got better.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\u201cIt\u2019s a good learning lesson on my end. Looking back at it, I should have definitely taken care of it. You\u2019re here to play and obviously it didn\u2019t work out for me because I thought it was going to get better over time, but it just kept getting worse and worse and worse so I decided to say something to the trainers.\u201d\n\nSource: [Baseball isn't boring](https://www.audacy.com/weei/sports/red-sox/mayer-isnt-about-to-take-his-eye-off-the-major-league-prize)\n\nMarcelo is still a young kid.  He's going to be able to drink a beer in a restaurant in a few weeks.  Next year, he's still at AA and hopefully he'll be fully healthy.  It's just an injury setback. Just because SP moved Mayer down to 2nd doesn't mean we should suddenly give up on him.  MLB still has him 11th in all of baseball.

I was surprised and actually shocked to see the general apathy towards a major international sporting brand shown by locals, tourists, and even fans in town for the Grand Prix itself. I made it a point to talk to people at bars, bartenders, hotel and casino staff, servers, etc about what F1 weekend has been like for them and (for locals anyway) how they feel about the A's coming to town. Regarding F1, the overwhelming response from locals was that they were surprised how little support there was for it. Bartenders said they expected to make three to four times the amount in tips that they'd normally make from working more hours and serving the masses. I was told by several bartenders and a friend of mine who manages a few different bars that the weekend was less busy than an average weekend during football season. The locals were staying away. The folks in town were not supporting local businesses and sticking to F1 events, and the Europeans were not tipping. There was definitely a sense of \"buyer's remorse\" and angst towards F1 coming to town. The city truly did not feel crowded until maybe Saturday afternoon. There was not nearly the same buzz that there is for other events like National Finals Rodeo, for example. \n\nRegarding the A's: Opinions ranged from one bartender who said \"Oh it was approved? That's cool. It'll be cool to have MLB here but I'm a Dodger fan. Hopefully people come into the bar to watch games.\" Most people were completely indifferent. One server said \"This isn't really a baseball town and we have so many sports already. The Knights were the first team here so they won the city over right away. The Raiders have fans travel in from all over, but they're the Raiders.\" She then asked if A's fans are anything like Raiders fans and will travel. I said absolutely not after what they've been through and certainly not 81 times per year. She said that there's no way that works then as nobody in town will support the team. Another bartender at a bar with an A's neon in it didn't even know why the A's neon was in the bar until I explained that they are moving here. \"Oh no way? I hadn't heard that. For like next season?\" That was the response from him. \n\nThe overwhelming feeling and indication from plummeting ticket and hotel prices was that people did not care about Formula One in Las Vegas, at least as far as attending the race goes. I cannot fathom how the locals and tourists will support a bottom feeding baseball team for 81 home dates in the summer time when budget projections call for attendance to average north of 25,000 per game and Kaval has boasted about charing $100 per ticket. The Raiders are an extremely popular brand and they only have to sell 8-9 home dates per year. Formula One is one of the largest international sporting brands on the planet, and it failed tremendously to meet local expectations when it came to economic impact. \n\nI cannot wait, when inevitably the A's project costs balloon before shovels are even in the ground and Fisher is forced to ask the city for more money. There is NO WAY the city votes to give another penny of public money to any other sporting project for the foreseeable future after what I witnessed and heard during the Grand Prix weekend. The public outcry will be amplified. Locals DO NOT want the A's. They don't care. They are so fatigued from every other sports and entertainment project that they have been asked to prop up that have not met expectations. \n\nTLDR: F1 vastly failed to meet expectaions for local businesses. There is little to no support for the A's coming in.

He immediately caused problems for his parents Donald and Doris Fisher, founders of the Gap clothing company, as his blood was incompatible with his mothers in the womb, and he required medical treatment from birth. It was almost as if Doris\u2019s body knew the true nature of this child and tried to spare the world of it.\n\nJohn was a precocious boy, known by his family as \u201cHarpo\u201d for the way he \u201charped\u201d on people until he got his way. This would emerge as a pattern throughout John\u2019s life.\n\nHe went to boarding school in New Hampshire like his siblings, where he was so homesick he barfed repeatedly (seriously), followed by a degree in politics from Princeton. After college he worked for the campaigns of community heroes Ronald Reagan and George HW Bush, followed by a job at a real estate corporation that mostly worked with his father, which failed. \n\nHaving failed out of all his employment up to this point, his father gave him a \u201cjob\u201d managing the family investment portfolio. One of his early investments immediately sparked outrage when he purchased redwood timberland in Mendocino county. He pledged to remain a good steward of the old growth forest, and then cut it down anyway. This misstep also drew attention to the concurrent lawsuit against The Gap for human rights violations at their garment factories in Saipan, in the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\nIn the 90\u2019s, John learned that his beloved San Francisco Giants might move to Tampa Bay, and Harpo set to work. He begged his father to allow him to purchase a stake in the Giants to keep them in the bay, and his father reluctantly agreed.\n\nFisher would go on to sell his Giants stake and purchase the A\u2019s in 2005, after which he and co-owner Lew Wolff immediately attempted to move the team to Fremont and then San Jose. After these attempts failed, the A\u2019s offered to redevelop the coliseum site, on the condition that the Raiders would be evicted. Finally, he choose a site at a college that he had no agreement with, which was rejected by said college, before finally being strong armed into MLB and the City\u2019s preferred Howard Terminal. \n\nIn the end, Harpo\u2019s $12 billion planned Howard Terminal redevelopment couldn\u2019t spare $80 million to bridge the funding gap with the City, and so he picked up and moved somewhere that would give him what he wanted, Las Vegas. \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/A-s-NEW-ERA-JOHN-FISHER-Son-of-Gap-founder-is-2719006.php\n\nhttps://www.sfgate.com/athletics/article/Who-is-John-Fisher-Inside-the-world-and-16315323.php", "date": "20231117", "sentiment": -0.7384}, {"ranking": 0.06896551724137931, "comments": "RIP Oakland Athletics ", "date": "20231116", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.06896551724137931, "comments": "The A\u2019s knew exactly what they\u2019re doing with their Rooted in Oakland BS campaign.

John Fisher baked his enemy's children into meat pies and fed them to him. He invested in the Sea Venture, and when it wrecked, he sent mercenaries to retrieve the indentured servants from paradise and took them to Johnstown where most of them died during their first winter.\n\nJohn Fisher is actually made entirely out of horse rectums and sheep testicles.

It's not that the team can't improve in those areas (I watched the same games in September and October as you did), but I can see starting pitching a little more clearly. That said, I should caveat once again that I\u2019m not really any more qualified to speak on this than Joe or Jane Doomer, but I\u2019m probably not alone in thinking trades are how Elias is going to make \u201cthis\u201d \u201c\u201dwork.\u201d\u201d\n\n**And if you don\u2019t have time to read 5,000 words, here\u2019s the summary in three tables:**\n\n**Fantastic**\n\n|Name|Team|IP|FA Year|ERA|FIP|xFIP|SIERA|K-BB%|vFA (sc)|Stuff+|Location+|Pitching+|\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|Dylan Cease|CHW|361.0|2026|3.37|3.40|3.78|3.79|18.55%|96.1|119.3|97.2|105.2|\n|Freddy Peralta|MIL|242.0|2027|3.64|3.56|3.50|3.49|21.56%|93.8|104.0|100.9|103.8|\n|Logan Gilbert|SEA|376.1|2028|3.47|3.66|3.77|3.81|18.10%|95.9|103.7|101.3|102.8|\n|Mitch Keller|PIT|347.1|2026|4.09|3.85|3.82|3.99|15.49%|95.3|103.2|101.7|101.6|\n\n**Acceptable**\n\n|Name|Team|IP|FA Year|ERA|FIP|xFIP|SIERA|K-BB%|vFA (sc)|Stuff+|Location+|Pitching+|\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|Bryce Miller|SEA|131.1|2030|4.32|3.98|4.31|4.17|17.32%|95.1|117.0|104.0|108.9|\n|Bryan Woo|SEA|87.2|2030|4.21|4.36|4.26|4.13|16.71%|95.1|103.2|101.8|103.6|\n|Reid Detmers|LAA|277.2|2028|4.15|3.97|4.24|4.13|15.55%|93.8|98.8|97.8|98.3|\n|Patrick Sandoval|LAA|293.1|2027|3.50|3.63|4.13|4.47|11.24%|93.0|93.2|97.7|98.1|\n\n**Disappointing**\n\n|Name|Team|IP|FA Year|ERA|FIP|xFIP|SIERA|K-BB%|vFA (sc)|Stuff+|Location+|Pitching+|\n:--|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|Michael Kopech|CHW|246.0|2026|4.35|5.50|5.28|5.10|8.34%|95.0|110.5|92.9|96.7|\n|Shane Bieber|CLE|328.0|2025|3.24|3.26|3.36|3.64|17.75%|91.3|99.1|102.2|100.8|\n|Ken Waldichuk|OAK|137.2|2029|5.23|5.46|4.97|4.78|10.93%|93.3|93.2|95.0|93.6|\n|JP Sears|- - -|225.0|2029|4.48|5.03|5.04|4.67|13.02%|93.1|91.3|100.3|98.7|\n|Paul Blackburn|OAK|214.0|2026|4.29|4.03|4.07|4.28|12.99%|91.7|86.5|101.4|96.9|\n|Brady Singer|KCR|307.1|2027|4.36|3.93|3.81|3.98|14.96%|92.7|90.1|100.8|97.0|\n\nWhat do you guys think? Who am I missing? Should I do a deeper dive into any individual pitcher?\n\n---\n\nLike last time, I used a simple query of [Stuff+ tables on FanGraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/leaders/major-league?pos=all&amp;lg=all&amp;ind=0&amp;stats=sta&amp;qual=100&amp;season1=2022&amp;season=2023&amp;type=36&amp;hand=&amp;sortcol=12&amp;sortdir=default&amp;pagenum=1) with minimum 100 IP across 2022-2023, and then sorted by Stuff+ descending. I just want to see guys with a reasonable amount of action without taking into the account the [covid years](https://www.baseballprospectus.com/news/article/84034/visualizing-the-infirmary-2020-2021-injuries/) or juiced ball era. Some of these guys had really bad 2023 seasons, so I thought that including 2022 would help with sample size. Plenty of guys have just one bad year or just one good year.\n\nThis is 186 guys. But the actual number is way lower because a lot of pitchers are disqualified for various reasons:\n\n- Free agents: see previous post, no need to review them again\n- Too expensive of a contract: Max Scherzer, Gerrit Cole (lol)\n- Injured: Brandon Woodruff, Germ\u00e1n M\u00e1rquez, Anthony DeSclafani, Brad Keller\n- Division rivals: I trust Elias to not get fleeced, but most of the time, I don\u2019t think these are worth it\n\nOther considerations:\n\n- The market is dependent on sellers. Every team that doesn\u2019t sell raises the price of everyone remaining.\n- We need to have the positions that sellers need, and the pitcher that we want can\u2019t figure heavily into their future plans. Rebuilding teams want cheap young starters. Conversely, I excluded guys on teams who need them to make a run. This takes out a *lot* of guys. The Brewers are borderline because they look like they're on the doorstep of blowing it up. I ultimately didn\u2019t include any Marlins because they have enough pitching on the IL that they need it unless they're doing a teardown.\n\nI list three categories below: *fantastic, acceptable, disappointing* in terms of showing how serious Elias is about winning *now*.\n\n**Format**: (Current Team; Stuff+ Location+ Pitching +; Year of FA; Age; Ranking on the [2023 trade value rankings](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2023-trade-value-nos-1-10/) by the Prophet Ben Clemens, peace be upon him).\n\n---\n\n***Fantastic***\n\nAs mentioned above, if Elias trades for these guys, that would show that he\u2019s serious about winning now - not in the long run, not over a sustained period - *now*. You can make these trades and still have longer term success; you're not emptying the farm, but you'll see fewer top 100s for a while.\n\n**Dylan Cease (Chicago White Sox; 119 97 105; 2026; 27 yr; HM)**\n\nThe man [purportedly worth Jackson Holliday](https://fansided.com/2023/07/03/mlb-rumors-cardinals-trade-braves-jackson-holliday-white-sox/). Free agent after 2025. Probably a better value deal than Corbin Burnes because Cease took a bigger step back in 2023, plus you get an extra year of control. A lot of us are tempted to match the arc of the Elias Orioles to the Luhnow Astros, which would make Cease Gerrit Cole. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s controversial to say Cole had better raw stuff, but I don\u2019t think Elias is willing to spend as much as his Houston predecessor. So if 2024 Cease is worse than 2018 Cole, I think that\u2019s a good thing.\n\nUnfortunately, I have no idea what the Chicago White Sox are doing because from what I can tell, their new GM was [part of the old regime,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Getz#Executive_career) so it's not clear to me if he\u2019s going to blow it up. And even if he does trade Cease, is he still going to ask for Jackson Holliday? There's no reason they shouldn't have started a rebuild at the deadline, frankly, so there's a good chance they just hold onto Cease and let him walk for nothing. \n\nI think most people reading the entire post already have a good feel for Cease's pitching profile. He loves his slider enough to [write a poem about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbYEDrXSiYI), and while I can never condone poetry, it did have a run value of +10 in 2023, a good number but a steep drop from the lava hot +36 in 2022. His disappointing 2023 still netted him 3.7 fWAR, with 4.5 and 4.4 in 2021 and 2022, respectively. He's also not a durability concern (as far as any pitcher can be not a durability concern), covering 165+ innings a year since 2021.\n\nHere's the counter argument: what if he doesn't turn it around stuff-wise? In 2023, he lost a tick off his fastball (96.9 in 2022 to 95.8 in 2023), lost an inch of vertical drop on the fastball, 1.5 horizontal inches on the slider. He\u2019s gone from 61.7 to 59.1 to 58.5 inches of vertical drop on the curveball from 2021 to 2022 to 2023. There are a lot of interweaving reasons why players\u2019 pitches move the way they do, so I can\u2019t assume these are strictly negative. I would guess losing a little bit of fastball ride is purely a bad thing, but he dropped 2.9 inches of horizontal break on his slider between 2021 and 2022, and 2022 was the year it was worth +36 runs. His knuckle curve had the second worst Stuff+ (87) with the filters used, and it was worth -12 runs in 2023. So what if he doesn't have a curve? Like [Eno Sarris pointed out in May](https://theathletic.com/4532034/2023/05/19/sarris-five-struggling-starters-futures/), it makes him more of a two-pitch pitcher, and is that a risk Elias is willing to take? \n\nAnyway, starting this list with Cease is kind of stupid because if he gets traded, it's going to be expensive, and he\u2019s a Boras client so we\u2019re not likely to extend or re-sign them. Even so, it's two years of control, so he\u2019s not a pure rental. The extra year is basically why I put Cease on this list and not Burnes. Burnes would immediately add three wins to our 2024 total but he\u2019s *also* a Boras client with only one year before free agency, so I\u2019m skeptical Elias will trade as much as he needs to to get only one year of an ace.\n\n**Freddy Peralta (Milwaukee Brewers; 104 101 104; 2025-2027; 27 yr; N/A)**\n\nHere is Peralta\u2019s contract: *5 yr, $15.5M (2020-24), 2025-26 $8M club options*\n\nSo even if it weren't for his stuff (114 four-seamer, 111 slider) or 92nd percentile whiff% and K%, the contract alone makes Peralta desirable - in his two club option years, he\u2019s going to make as much as Burnes is likely to get in arbitration in just 2024.\n\nWith [Brandon Woodruff out for 2024](https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2023/10/brandon-woodruff-expected-to-miss-most-of-2024-after-shoulder-surgery.html), GM David Stearns and manager Craig Counsell both gone, and all three of Burnes, Woodruff, and SS Willy Adames pending free agents in 2024, this might be the guy to take a swing on. It all depends on if the Brewers fold and trade for the future. It\u2019s important to remember the Brewers are also cheapskates, so they could also sit on his cost-controlled contract.\n\nPeralta didn't even make [honorable mention](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2023-trade-value-introduction-and-honorable-mentions/) this past trade deadline, \"Peralta is on a cheap deal but hardly elite.\" But if you ask me, the stuff is good, he's averaged ~3.0 fWAR and ~3.50 xFIP each of the past three seasons with ERA/xERA/FIP values that hover around 3.00, and that contract is cheap for a modest number of years (John Angelos if you're reading this I KNOW YOU CAN AFFORD HIS 2025-2026 OPTIONS).\n\nThere\u2019s a lot to say about Peralta\u2019s four-seamer and fastball shape in general, but long story short, I think his is an excellent complement to our team arsenal. The summary is that it works really well because of a low release point, good vertical approach angle (VAA), good extension, and good deception (hiding the ball until it whips out of his hand). His induced vertical break (IVB) is average, but the other characteristics of his fastball make up for it.\n\nThe counter argument: look at his innings pitched. 144.1 in 2021, 165.2 in 2023, nothing north of 90 IP any other year since his 2018 debut. Which guy are we trading for? Elias will want to pay for 2022, Brewers want to sell for 2021/2023.\n\n**Logan Gilbert (Seattle Mariners; 104 101 103; 2028; 26 yr; #33)**\n\nGilbert is the most expensive pitcher in this review. He's a proven frontline starter with four years of team control remaining, including one pre-arbitration. He's also durable at 180+ IP in each of the last three seasons. \n\nI listed only Gilbert among Seattle's TOR arms because I find it exceedingly unlikely we'll trade for George Kirby (#26 by Clemens) let alone Luis Castillo. Kirby is younger and has both better command and an extra year of control over Gilbert; the bidding would probably *start* at several top 100s. As for Gilbert, none of our starters throw a splitter and our main splitter guy is out for at least a year, so I think he's a good fit for varying the team's pitch mix. \n\nIf Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez doesn't re-sign, the Mariners have an opening for a righty outfield bat, given Kelenic, Canzone, and Marlowe are all lefties. I think Santander is an upgrade from Hern\u00e1ndez, but you'd obviously need to throw in a *lot* more to get Gilbert's value. It's four years of team control, and the Blue Jays traded one year of Hern\u00e1ndez for three years of *reliever* Erik Swanson plus lottery ticket [Adam Macko](https://www.mlb.com/prospects/bluejays/adam-macko-671936). If you consider Santander (2025 FA) equivalent to pre-2023 Hern\u00e1ndez, what do you consider the gap between Gilbert and Swanson? That's what we need to fill with ML-quality bats. You now see the difficulty.\n\nAnd here's the counter argument: does he give up contact that's too hard? He's had bottom quarter average EV and HH% all three years he's pitched. His barrel% is below average but at least 33rd percentile, so it's not like he's giving up nukes every time batters make contact. He\u2019s been a little homerun prone in 2023, but you swap out Kreme-dawg for Gilbert and you\u2019re probably adding at least two wins. In the sense that he has the fewest obvious red flags of any pitcher in this tier, I wouldn't second guess this too much.\n\n**Mitch Keller (Pittsburgh Pirates; 103 102 102; 2026; 27 yr; N/A)**\n\nMitch Keller was by far the best Pittsburgh starter, but if you look at his season numbers, he was actually \"just\" above average. Solid K%, BB%, and HH%, but his barrel% and whiff% are meh, and his recent (250 PA) rolling xwOBA is average, too. He was sublime when he came to Baltimore in May, but then he just kept getting tagged for a ton of runs. Five or more runs *seven* times after May. I don't watch enough NL baseball to really understand what happened to him, but based on a [little research](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/hows-that-new-cutter-treating-you/), it might be that something messed with his release point, stuff, and velocity and caused his results to crater after May. But there's a lot going on here because Keller throws as many as six pitches, and I won't assume it's all caused by one thing. \n\nThis trade might actually be doable because he's got only two years left on his contract and he's not in the power level of Cease or as cheap for as long as Gilbert. But [he himself wants to stay in Pittsburgh](https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2023/09/30/pittsburgh-pirates-mitch-keller-contract-extension-offseason-steve-blass-award-bbwaa/stories/202309300082), and there was smoke earlier in the season about a [long-term extension](https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-rumors-pirates-mitch-keller-discussing-long-term-extension-during-breakout-season/).\n\nI think this is the right guy from a trade value perspective. The question is if we can meet Pittsburgh's needs. They're a young team with few expiring contracts (McCutcheon, Vince Velasquez), so it's not clear to me they want what we have. The [FanGraphs rankings](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2023-positional-power-rankings-summary/) at the start of the year put them at bottom five at 2B, RF, and RP, and bottom 10 at C, DH, and SP. Unfortunately, the inclusion of both starting *and* relief pitching there makes me think they\u2019re going to want pitching back if they trade Keller. And if that\u2019s the case, we might be shit out of luck. The Pirates also have a [history](https://www.bucsdugout.com/2021/12/15/22837648/the-archer-trade-pittsburgh-pirates-chris-archer-tyler-glasnow-austin-meadows-shane-baz) of letting [good pitchers](https://www.milb.com/news/pittsburgh-pirates-acquire-colin-moran-jason-martin-from-houston-astro-264678106) go for an unfavorable return, so who knows, maybe they\u2019ll go in for another one. \n\nCounter argument: everything before 2023 and everything after May. If you believe his improvements are here to stay, he's a good investment. Or, are we buying his peak? \n\n---\n\n***Acceptable***\n\nOops All AL West! These are the kind of trades that I hoped Elias would make *last* offseason, so I\u2019d still be pretty happy with them. These are all cheap starters with at least three years of control. These guys still aren\u2019t cheap, but we would have to give up less for them, and if they develop with the rest of the team\u2019s young core of position players, this tier might actually be better from a timeline/competitive window perspective.\n\n**Bryce Miller (Seattle Mariners; 117 104 109; 2030; 25 yr; HM)**\n\n**Bryan Woo (Seattle Mariners; 103 102 104; 2030; 23 yr; HM)**\n\nBryce Miller? The guy who [only throws fastballs](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/what-if-they-made-the-entire-pitch-mix-out-of-fastballs/) has above average stuff on four of his five pitches? And he has five pitches?\n\nMiller had a solid rookie season, albeit very five-and-divey: 11 of his 25 starts were 5.0 IP or fewer, and after a blazing hot start of only four runs in 31.1 IP, he gave up 59 runs in the remaining 100 IP (read: &gt;5 ERA). But his fastball *looks* quite good: among 2022-2023 starters, t-9th in four-seamer Stuff+ at 121, 18th in IVB at 18.4\u201d, and 23rd in VAA above average at +0.42\u00b0. It is therefore unsurprising that he throws the heater almost 60% of the time, even if its run value per 100 pitches is literally 0.0.\n\nThe bad news: Miller and Woo came up in 2023, so the Mariners have six years of control. I can\u2019t find anything about Woo\u2019s contract status, and Baseball Reference says he still hasn\u2019t exceeded his rookie limits, but I\u2019m going to assume since he was on the big league roster for quite a while, this is just a documentation issue. Woo was 12.1 innings short of my 100 IP threshold, but it\u2019s not like you can set Miller\u2019s destiny in stone after 131.1 IP, either.\n\nYou could argue Woo\u2019s [better peripherals](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/bryan-woo-693433?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) make him a more appealing candidate, and I think Woo is one of the few pitchers I\u2019ve seen with a high Stuff+ sinker at 109. FanGraphs lead prospect writer Eric Longenhagen [grades Miller at 50 FV and Woo at 45+](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/seattle-mariners-top-31-prospects-2023/), so it\u2019s close. An important detail that Longenhagen highlights is that he considers both of these guys to still be developing, so I don\u2019t really ding Woo\u2019s Stuff+ because I assume it\u2019s going to grow.\n\nSeattle has a weird front office. I wouldn\u2019t call them cheap, since they gave Robbie Ray a five year, $115MM contract and then they gave Julio Rodr\u00edguez a titanic extension that could top out at $400MM. On the other hand, after the 2022 season, they gave contracts to (checks notes) Kolten Wong, A.J. Pollock, and Tommy La Stella. Point being, I won\u2019t be surprised if they pocket these young starters and let them develop some more. If they end up as good as Gilbert and Kirby, the Mariners can flip them for a lot more than what they can get now.\n\nThe main argument against these guys is that they have 200 career innings combined and many of them came in spurts of five innings or fewer. I peered over at the Mariners sub and found a [good, basic comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mariners/comments/17udvkz/how_do_you_differentiate_between_woo_and_miller/k94lwor/) about the differences and potential tweaks these guys need to make. Point being, they have potential, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re buying here.\n\n**Reid Detmers (Los Angeles Angels; 99 98 98; 2028; 24 yr; N/A)**\n\n**Patrick Sandoval (Los Angeles Angels; 93 98 98; 2027; 27 yr; N/A)**\n\nReid Detmers has a hittable four-seamer and two reasonably good breaking balls - sound familiar to another Angel we traded for?\n\nHe had a funky 2023: 3.72 ERA / 3.26 FIP over his first 15 starts before giving up 29 R/ER in 25.1 innings over the next six starts and then finished the season with only 13 R/11 ER in 41.0 innings. Because of that disastrous stretch where he gave up nine home runs in six games, the season line looks middling at 4.48 ERA 4.13 FIP, but if you look under the hood, it, uh, also looks middling with a 4.45 xERA and 4.27 xFIP.\n\nBut that might be fine because we want guys whose potential we can unlock. Given Detmers isn\u2019t a free agent until 2028, I have a feeling the Angels would probably prefer to keep him anyway since a rebuild shouldn\u2019t really take more than four or five years, and the next couple years of development could mean they could sell high in 2026 or 2027.\n\nFor a long time, I thought highly of Patrick Sandoval because I watched him mow down the Mariners in person a few years ago. Unfortunately for him, his 2023 was a rough ride. I\u2019m curious if he has issues getting tilted, since only 66 of his 89 runs given up in 2023 were earned. Moreover, he\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction on both strikeouts and walks to the tune of a 8.3% K-BB% in 2023.\n\nWith one fewer year of team control than Detmers and seemingly on the downslide, this might be an opportunity to steal him from the Angels. I see them as more likely to move on from him than Detmers because every couple of starts we see flashes of brilliance from Detmers, and he could be the guy for them to build around moving forward.\n\nStuff+ doesn\u2019t like Sandoval, but I believe we can do more with less. Sandoval was also originally an Elias draftee back in Houston, and Elias [liked him quite a bit](https://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2015/07/07/astros-find-enough-leftover-money-to-sign-premium-11th-round-pick-patrick-sandoval/), \u201cPatrick is a premium high school lefty whom our staff followed all spring. [...] He has good size, a lively fastball that he locates well, and a solid curveball and changeup in place. We like the blend of pitchability, stuff and projection he offers, and to add a talent of his caliber is a big boost to [the Houston Astros] and our draft class.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s only 27. And a lefty.\n\nWhat's the argument against them? Detmers has a middling fastball and can be disastrously inconsistent. If Sandoval\u2019s single-digit K-BB% is not a fluke, then\u2026 he has a single-digit K-BB%.\n\n---\n\n***Disappointment***\n\nI don\u2019t have anything personal against these guys, it\u2019s just more along the lines of the small additions we\u2019ve seen since last winter. I think this is probably the most likely bucket we see.\n\n**Michael Kopech (Chicago White Sox; 111 93 97; 2026; 27 yr; N/A)**\n\nI was surprised to see him on this list when I remembered this is stuff, not location. His Location+ is the lowest of anybody on this list at 93, tied for lowest of *all* 100+ IP starters 2022-2023, and lowest of all 100+ IP starters in 2023 alone at 91. The fastball is still his big pitch, but with 1st percentile BB% *and* barrel%, he needs some work.\n\nNot sure this guy is worth it even as a reliever unless the FO sees something they can actually fix. I watched this guy a couple of times last season and it seems like he legitimately has 20 command. His 15.5% BB% in 2023 was by far the worst among starters, with Blake Snell's 13.3% a distant second, and that doesn't even really count since Snell is a prodigious nibbler.\n\n**Shane Bieber (Cleveland Guardians; 99 102 101; 2025; 28 yr; N/A)**\n\nThis is mostly a repost of what I said in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/17hr9cn/mlbtr_offseason_outlook_baltimore_orioles/), but my thoughts are intact:\n\nI had kind of written off Shane Bieber assuming the Guardians were going to push with their young pitching corps (Tanner Bibee, Gavin Williams, Triston McKenzie, etc.) and a weak AL Central, but I guess it aligns with their previous practices to sell pitchers on the verge of implosion like Corey Kluber.\n\nAfter a very good 2022 (2.88 ERA/3.51 xERA/2.87 FIP/2.98 xFIP) where he struck out a batter an inning and had a career high (career low? the good one) in walk rate, he had an injury-riddled 2023 where he was basically a whole run worse by each headline stat. The good news is he still doesn't walk a lot of guys, and his GB rate is competitive.\n\nBeyond the injury, the troubling stuff is obvious: his strikeout rate (and whiff rate correspondingly) has really declined from 33.1% to 25.0% to 20.1% over the past three years, and his fastball continues to lose roughly a tick a year.\n\nIf you want an unambitious rental, you could do worse than Shane Bieber. But I don't think he's the guy you want if you want to improve the club enough to not regress to the 89-win record by BaseRuns in 2023. But if you're going to do that, why not just pay a free agent $10MM-$15MM (assuming you won't spend more than that anyway) and save the trade chips for something bigger?\n\n**Ken Waldichuk (Oakland Athletics; 93 95 94; 2029; N/A)**\n\n**JP Sears (Oakland Athletics; 91 100 99; 2029; N/A)**\n\n**Paul Blackburn (Oakland Athletics; 87 101 97; 2026; N/A)**\n\nTwo below average Oakland lefties with five years of team control and then a below average righty with two years of team control. I don\u2019t have much to say about these guys other than their peripherals are kinda crummy, and they\u2019re in the same style of pitcher as Cole Irvin, except Waldichuk walks a lot of guys, JP Sears has a good VAA fastball, and Blackburn had a &lt;4 FIP last year.\n\nThere\u2019s no Matt Olson or Sean Murphy to be robbed here. We can try again in 2028 or later when Brent Rooker, Zack Gelof, and Mason Miller are nearing free agency.\n\n**Brady Singer (Kansas City Royals; 90 101 97; 2027; 27 yr; N/A)**\n\nBrady Singer has two pitches (sinker slider), below average fastball velocity, and he took a big step back in 2023 after a pretty good 2022 where in 153.1 IP he had a 3.23 ERA/3.97 xERA/3.58 FIP/3.30 xFIP. Like Bieber, his GB rate is good, and he doesn't walk too many guys.\n\nBut don't you want more than that? Like everybody else in this tier, Singer asks the question, \"are we making the rotation any better by starting this guy instead of 2024 Kremer or 2023 Gibson?\"\n\n---\n\nI know I\u2019m asking for a lot. Logan Gilbert and Freddy Peralta are good pitchers, and I\u2019m not even sure either team is interested in selling their major leaguers. But it\u2019s the start of the offseason. Let\u2019s keep dreaming at least until February\u2026\n\nGuys who are missing from this list:\n\n- **Corbin Burnes; Milwaukee Brewers** - I know, he should be in the first tier. But like I said, I don\u2019t think I can expect Elias to trade for definitively one year of an ace in the one season we *don\u2019t* have our Paul Bunyan closer. Burnes objectively makes the team better, but it seems like pulling the fire alarm in year two of contention.\n- **Tyler Glasnow; Tampa Bay Rays** - he\u2019s [likely available](https://twitter.com/tbtimes_rays/status/1716200970852454888), but he\u2019s due $25MM with only one year of control, and trading with the Rays is dangerous.\n- **George Kirby; Seattle Mariners** - too expensive. We're going to have trouble enough finding assets to get Gilbert - who would we need to trade to get Kirby?\n- **Jes\u00fas Luzardo, Edward Cabrera, Braxton Garrett; Miami Marlins** - down one Sandy and one Pablo, I think the Marlins no longer have a starting pitching surplus. But if they were willing to trade, Garrett would be a good pickup. Below average velo and underwhelming Stuff+, but he doesn\u2019t walk guys, has a high GB rate, and is a lefty. Again, you want more than just that, but it'll take a lot more to dislodge Luzardo. No proven lefty starter throws a harder fastball.\n- **Nick Pivetta; Boston Red Sox** - Pivetta has a good fastball with ride, good whiff% and K%; the downside is that he has only a year before free agency, 2nd percentile barrel%, and he's a flyball pitcher. If he dropped onto our 40-man tomorrow, I'd be happy to replace Kremer with him. But he plays for Boston and I'm loath to trade them any righty bats.\n- **Triston McKenzie; Cleveland Guardians** - Sticks would've been a great pickup last year, such that there was a 0% chance the Guards would've traded him. But now they have a glut of young pitchers, except McKenzie hurt his UCL (!) and was pretty bad in limited action. \n- **Logan Webb; San Francisco Giants** - honestly, I have no idea what the Giants are doing, but they just extended him with an excellent five year, $90MM contract, so it'd be silly to trade him now. Great value. \n- **Jameson Taillon; Chicago Cubs** - it's an affordable contract, but he was terrible in 2023. I have to think Elias can do better for the same amount of money. \n- **Cole Ragans; Kansas City Royals** - I think the Royals know what they have. His stock has never been higher, so we might as well wait a year to see if comes back down to earth.\n- **Tarik Skubal; Detroit Tigers** - Skubal seemed like a guy to try to vulture in 2022, but then he got hurt, and Detroit turned in a solid 2023 with a 78-84 base runs record and quality contributions from guys like Spencer Torkelson, Riley Greene, and Kerry Carpenter. At this point, if the people running the Tigers know what they\u2019re doing, they need to push and build around this guy. But yes, he\u2019s a hard-throwing lefty. If we *could* get him, that\u2019d be great. Timing just doesn\u2019t make sense.\n- **Griffin Canning; Los Angeles Angels** - injury prone and unlike the other Angels listed above, he's a righty.\n- **Brandon Woodruff; Milwaukee Brewers** - not a trade candidate, but a guy who was non-tendered. Woodruff is an interesting candidate because he\u2019s basically been an above average starter his [whole career](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/brandon-woodruff-continues-to-be-brandon-woodruff/), but had the misfortune of having a pair of terribly timed injuries - one preventing him from playing in most of 2023, and then another preventing him from playing likely all of 2024. If a team signs Woodruff, it\u2019s going to be some kind of weird two or three-year deal where things balance out such that he\u2019s pretty cheap during his year of rehab.\n\n---\n\n**Credits:**\n\n- Basically all data comes from one of FanGraphs (contract data, team payroll, summary tables, anything with xFIP or Stuff+/Location+/Pitching+), Baseball Reference (contract data, anything detailing stretches of a particular season), or Baseball Savant (pitch mix, run value, barrel%, HH%, etc.).

But doing a little digging, it has been 20 years since a low payroll team has won the WS.  Every WS winner since had a payroll in the top 1/2.   In 2003 the Marlins had the 25th highest payroll.

It's a really bad day in baseball history and it's going to make it super hard to care about baseball going forward, at least for me. So many cities are being threatened with losing their teams so their billionaire owners can extract more wealth from struggling cities' budgets and this sets a bad precedent. \n\nI love baseball. I've been a lifelong Orioles fan, my grandparents were season ticket holders for decades and started to attend games literally the moment the Orioles came to Baltimore (my grandfather also ran a farm team and coached little league for decades in my western MD hometown). While the Orioles have always been my home team, I have come to love the A's ever since moving to Oakland 10 years ago, and I root for them as my 2nd choice team. \n\nIf you have never been to the Oakland Coliseum for an A's game, I'm truly sorry you missed out. I've been to 8 baseball stadiums and outside of Camden Yards. There's been no other place I'd rather watch baseball. As a stark contrast to SF Giants fans, the A's fans are some of the most passionate, die-hard fans I've ever experienced. Even as Fisher under invested in the team, sold of the best players, closed concessions, jacked up ticket prices, and started to threaten to leave as soon as he bought the team, A's fans always made that stadium feel electric whether it was sold out or just a couple of thousand fans. \n\nIt feels like an extra shitty day in baseball as the MLB owners voted to waive relocation fees and allow a billionaire trust fund baby to abandon one of the most diverse cities in the country, with one of the largest and wealthiest baseball markets, and perfect weather most days of the year, to set up shop in Vegas, a small market in the middle of the desert. If the Raiders games are any indication, future A's players will be playing in a mostly empty stadium where most of the fans will be rooting for the opposing team. Who wants to watch baseball in 120 degree weather?\n\nAnyway, thanks for letting me rant. I'm sad and angry, and feeling frustrated with Manfred, MLB team owners, and it sucks watching people who don't know anything about the situation or Oakland talk shit about this beautiful city, much like how people denigrate Baltimore without knowing what they're talking about.

We got some good news with the manager and rookie of the year nominations coming out, along with our boy K-Brad getting 39 points in the Cy Young voting, behind former Oriole Kevin Gausman. A Twitter comment lead me to look into the advanced stats, and what I found was quite surprising. Take a look. \n\nfrom fangraphs:\nGaus-\nIP (18 more) |\nK/9 |\nWAR (obviously Gaus, had 3 more GS)\n\nBradish-\nBB/9 |\nHR/9 |\nBABIP |\nLOB% |\nGB% |\nERA |\nxERA \n\nAs we know, unfortunately Bradish's innings total was cut short by a freak accident at the start of the season in Texas, when his ankle got drilled with a hard hit ball. Due to this, he obviously has less innings pitched, and less WAR. Gaus also has a higher FIP, but the amount of advanced stats KB has over him is definitely interesting.

I don't think people (mostly Rangers fans) realize that this is a regular season award. Not only was Hyde more consistent in the Regular season, he straight up won more games. The Rangers had a very bad end to the regular season and fell out of the #1 spot in their division, (which means nothing since they won the WS, but again, postseason doesn't matter for this award) and that definitely hurt Bochy's chances for the award.\n\nIn the end, if you look at it through the regular season, Hyde OBVIOUSLY deserves this award. Bochy was phenomenal but this isn't a postseason award.

From the newest episode of Extra Innings. \n\n\u201cOur buddy Daniel Kramer got beat up pretty good for writing what is essentially true. On the record or off the record, if you talk to anybody in the Mariners organization that conversation ends really quickly. You can be talking about anything else and you mention that name [Ohtani] and it\u2019s like \u201cNope, not going there. We\u2019re not talking about this.\u201d Partially because Shohei\u2019s camp said that anybody who talks about it or gets public with it, they\u2019ll hold it against them. And I think it worked against Jerry Dipoto the last time when he had his podcast talking about all that stuff. \n\nSo what Daniel wrote, it\u2019s nothing untrue. Nobody ever thought the Mariners we\u2019re going to make the highest offer to him. Nobody thought that they would get into a bidding war with the Dodgers or the Giants. Nobody thought that they would give him $600 million over ten years, nobody thought that was going to be the case. And then, if you\u2019re that way you have to prepare like you\u2019re not going to get him. So in their mind they\u2019re probably hearing what other teams are offering and thinking we can\u2019t compete with that. \n\nAnd they don\u2019t really know what he wants until he sits down. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re trying to put together the best offer they can. It\u2019ll be creative because that\u2019s what they do. It wont be as high in total salary and probably wont be as many years committed. It\u2019ll probably be shorter with higher AAV and that\u2019s kind of what they can work with. And I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to tell Ohtani, like, look, this is what we can offer you. This is what we can offer you from a player and pitcher standpoint and all this other stuff. And that\u2019s how they sell it. \n\nSo I don\u2019t understand why people were so pissed off at what Daniel wrote. I looked on that Reddit thread and they were just killing him. Like, oh this is bad reporting. No, this is pretty much what everybody is hearing. It\u2019s written in a different way. But I think we\u2019ve said all along that it\u2019s a weird needle that they have to thread about how they can attract him. Because it\u2019s not going to be about money or tradition or any of that. It\u2019s what can they do for him, how can they make him the most comfortable, give him the freedom and maybe push on the young talent they\u2019d have around him which is very different than the team he just left.\u201d", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9768}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "[Passan]: Catcher/outfielder Cooper Hummel has been claimed off waivers by the New York Mets, sources tell ESPN.

I made a comment about this the other day, but I think it deserves its own post.\n\nThe Mariners current presumed lineup going into next season could be good enough. I don't think it's likely to be, and I think it would be a bad bet, but I wanted to look at what needs to fall the right way in order for that to happen.\n\nHere's what I think would be needed, in order of most likely to least likely:\n\n1. **Julio needs to continue to step forward.** This is the best bet in the whole thing. The talent is all there, and at this point not fulfilling that promise would be among the greatest disappointments in baseball history. He is who he is, he just needs to be more of that.\n2. **Ty France needs to bounce back.** Now, I think everyone will agree this is one of the bets, but it might be controversial how high I'm putting this. I want to be clear--I'm not expecting a career year out of him necessarily, but 2023 was one bad year, and he's not even 30. There's nothing on earth to suggest that he can't work out the physical issues that likely hampered him last season. I'm predicting now that he'll be at least close to his 2022 self next year.\n3. **Cal needs to continue as he has.** Cal Raleigh needs to hit a pack of home runs, and have power. As long as he does that, he's solid. If he can get the batting average up and strikeouts down, even better.\n4. **We want JP to be as dominant as he was in 2023.** I hate putting this in 4th place on my bets here, but the season was an outlier. 19 home runs, 94 walks, .380 OBP? That's a massively different player than who he's been for his whole career prior, and while I hope that's a legit step forward, it's not the best bet. That said, JP from prior years is good enough to be on a championship lineup if the rest of the team is where they need to be.\n5. Alright, those four are my safer bets, the ones I feel good about. Then we're getting into the territory of worse bets: **Kelenic needs to be good.** He's got the talent. It's all there. I love his edge and I think he brings a personality that I like to see a little of on a team. Can he play like he did early in the season? Can he avoid getting injured in fights with appliances? He's young, and his leap forward last year was promising--this year will probably tell the tale of his career. If he takes another step forward, he's going to be a superstar. If he stays about the same, he could be a valuable roleplayer on teams. If he regresses, he probably washes out of the MLB in a couple years. If I had to bet, I think the middle option is the most likely.\n6. **Rojas and Urias both need to be at their best.** I'm not saying they need to be superstars, they don't. But if they can both match their performance in their best year (2021 for Urias, 2022 for Rojas, so not ancient history), then they are solid players in an infield that also includes bounceback Ty and godlike JP. I think it's likely we get one of them playing at that level, but not both of them.\n7. **One of out AAAA outfielders needs to turn into a major league outfielder.** I've been a Mariners fan since 2013, and in that time we have a long history of having AAAA players who are too good for AAA, where they look like gods among insects, but then look completely hopeless in the majors. This year we had Hummel, Marlowe, Canzone, and Haggerty all in that role. I think our best bet there might be Haggerty, who has shown at least some ability to hit in the majors, though he's also 30 so there's less chance of him becoming a different player. But we would need just one of those guys to become a really good batter going into next year--which is not impossible, but man does it look unlikely.\n\nSo what does this mean to me?\n\nWell, it means I'm happy enough with the top four spots left as they are. I think each of those has a better than 50% chance of working out well enough. I might like to see an alternative to France being brought in to compete for that role in spring training, but otherwise I don't see any changes there--the Mariners should bet those things work out, and I won't blame them if they don't.\n\nFor the other three though... the Mariners have to replace Teo's offensive production. Betting on one of those other guys becoming taking a step forward is too big a gamble for this coming season. The Mariners need to bring in someone to play either 2nd or 3rd. I think if we fill one of those roles, then betting on *either* Rojas or Urias to play well is a lot more sure than betting *both* Rojas and Urias play well. And finally... the Mariners need to have a plan for moving on from Kelenic if he's not working out. I hope he's in the starting lineup, but I want the Mariners to have a plan B there.\n\nIf the Mariners legitimately target those things, then I'll be pretty excited. If they don't... well, I'll be confused and upset, and I'll see that as a bad gamble all around.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9992}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "[pitchingninja] Top 8 Filthiest Pitches of 2023 includes 3 Mariners.

In my view, they should go in with a few goals: 1) Improve the offense, especially at Shortstop and Catcher. 2) Acquire young, cheap, players with many years of team control without depleting the farm system. 3) Improve starting pitching depth. The Marlins need to build on last season's momentum while also being sustainable, extending players or trading them before their contracts expire. These moves should help achieve that, while also keeping payroll at a pretty realistic level. Bruce probably won't spend like this, but this should be within the realm of possibility.\n\nLet me know what you think!\n\nHere would be my idea of a good offseason:\n\n1. Trade CL Tanner Scott to the Orioles in exchange for SS Joey Ortiz\n2. Trade SP Max Meyer/Trevor Rogers/Edward Cabrera to the Cardinals in exchange for C Ivan Herrera, OF/1B Alec Burleson, and a prospect\n3. Sign CF Jung-hoo Lee to a 4-year, $56 million contract\n4. Extend 2B Luis Arraez on a 7-year, $90 million contract\n5. Sign a right-handed bullpen piece\n6. Sign a fifth starter, like Wade Miley, Frankie Montas, Jakob Junis, Trevor Bauer?, etc.\n7. Non-tender C Jacob Stallings\n8. Release RF Avisail Garcia\n9. Add 1B Troy Johnston and RP Anthony Maldonado to the 40-man roster\n10. Non-tender Garrett Hampson and sign him to a minor-league contract\n\nThese moves would result in the following roster in 2024:\n\nStarting lineup\n\n1. 2B Luis Arraez\n2. LF Jung-Hoo Lee\n3.

But then I learned that Peter Bendix, general manager of the Rays, is becoming to Miami as president of baseball operations. The Rays are a great example for the Fish to emulate.\n\nFor the past six years, I have been measuring MLB team efficiencies: Payroll divided by victories. I use Spotrac for payroll, because it includes all paid players, even those no longer on the active roster.\n\nThis year, the Rays spent a mere $801,000 per regular season victory. Contrast that with teams like the Angels and Mets, who consistently spend huge amounts for naught. This year, the five teams that spent the most per win didn\u2019t make the playoffs: Rockies ($2.9 million per win), Padres ($3.1 M), Angels ($3.15 M), Yankees ($3,4 M) and the Mets at an astonishing $4.6 million per win.\n\nThis year, the Orioles were the most efficient, spending $700,000 for each win during the regular season. The Rays\u2019 figure put them in second place.\n\nThis year\u2019s post-season was a bit weird: The big-win teams in the regular season \u2013 Braves, Dodgers, Orioles, Rays \u2013 collapsed in the playoffs, taken over by wild-card teams on hot streaks.\n\nThe big-spending Rangers -- $251 million payroll \u2013 paid $2.8 million per regular season victory.\n\nThe frugal D-backs spent $119 million, just a bit more than the Marlins\u2019 $105 M. The Snakes and Fish each had 84 wins in the regular season, Miami spending $1.25 M per win, Arizona $1.4 M (half as much as the Rangers). During the playoffs, Arizona got hot. The Fish did not.\n\nLooking back over the six years, what impresses me is that some teams are consistently smart on how they spend their money \u2013 and some teams are astoundingly stupid year after year.\n\nThe Rays lead the way despite miserable attendance. For the past four years, the Orioles have had good efficiency \u2013 low cost per win \u2013 and finally made the playoffs this year.\n\nThen there are the Pirates and A\u2019s: Great bargains in cost-per-win, but not a whiff of playoffs. Each spent roughly $1 million per win \u2013 far below the Padres, Yanks, Angels and Mets\u2014that spent more than $3 million per win.\n\nThe World Champ Rangers are an interesting case. They had the fourth highest payroll \u2013 behind only the Mets, Yankees and Padres. Yet $96M of their $251M was injured reserve, led by deGrom at $30 million. Seager ($35.5 million) was a major factor for their success, but so were Evan Carter (adjusted salary $89,033 because he had less than 100 AB when he came up at the end of the season), Josh Jung ($721,000), Leodys Taveras $733,000, Josh Sborz $733,000 and Adolis Garcia $747,000.

For all the tearing down and building back up and tearing down again the Rangers have done this century, Young and Bochy have given the organization a true direction.

It\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe Rangers won the World Series after defeating the Arizona Diamondbacks in five games. During that series, Carter was pivotal; he had six hits in 21 at-bats and set the record for the most doubles in a single postseason with nine.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the end goal of everybody; you want to win the last game of the year,\u201d Carter said. \u201cI was fortunate enough to do that at such a young age, so it\u2019s gonna be\u2026hopefully the standard\u2019s been set for the rest of the career.\u201d\n\nCarter told News Channel 11 that while the last few weeks could be described as a whirlwind, it has been full of experiences. His hometown of Elizabethton has been a constant stream of encouragement, Carter said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really cool to see how many people are supporting us and how many people have reached out,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, Elizabethton is hosting The Parade of Champions to honor him. The parade starts at 6:30 p.m. following the lighting of the Fraser Fir.\n\n\u201cIt makes my wife and I feel really special and appreciated. It\u2019s gonna be a ton of fun to be able to get out there and get to spend some time with the people that have supported us.\u201d\n\nCarter is enjoying the offseason and the title of champion, but he has no plans of slowing down in his baseball career.

Just wanted to share a story with yall that only a few friends and family know about. \n\nI have a curse, a jersey curse. The long and short of it is I can't own jerseys of players and I actively avoid buying and being gifted jerseys. \n\nMy first bought jersey was a Julius Jones jersey. We share the same last name and he was the premiere back for the Cowboys at the time. Well about 2-3 games after I bought it he got hurt. He came back and almost immediately got hurt again for the season. The next season he got hurt pretty early on but still played most of the season. I didn't think much of it b/c he turned it around and had his best season following that. \n\nIn 2006 my friend who was super into the Mavs bought me a Dirk jersey. You couldn't find a bigger Dirk or Mavs fan, like for real it was borderline obsession. They were doing great that year he bought me the jersey shortly after the sweep of Memphis sometime in the San Antonio series. I think we all know what happened in the Finals, if you don't well the short story is the Mavs went up 2-0 on the Heat. By the time the series was over Dallas would combine for a total of approx 97 fouls (in favor of the team), Dwayne Wade by himself totaled approx 93. The fix was in if you watched those games, it felt terrible. Even worse when the very next year a gambling controversy would get a few refs in the NBA fired for fixing games. \n\n2011 rolls around. For my birthday my parents get me a Nelson Cruz jersey. I think we all remember that year. IIRC he also never played for the Rangers again after that. This is when I started to have serious suspicions. \n\n2014: For Christmas my brother got me a gridiron grey Romo jersey. Soon after that the infamous no catch would happen and our best shot since 1995 went down the drain. Romo would go on to the next year and break his collar bone in week 4 (I think). He'd rush back after injury and again break his collar bone and be out for the season. The next year he broke his back in a preseason game when he fell awkwardly and had a defender land on him. He would play 6 more downs as a nod in the last regular season game. He never played football again. I now know without a shadow of doubt that any jersey I own will end in tragedy for the player whose name resides on the back. It's at this point I tell my family to never buy me a jersey again, and I to this day have never bought one for myself again. \n\n2019: Leighton Vander-esch is a promising 2nd year LB for the Cowboys. He had a phenomenal rookie season and looked to repeat it. Instead he sprain his neck, needed surgery and was out for the rest of the season. That neck injury still plagues him today and he has to wear a special collar to reduce reinjury. \n\n2023: My brother decided that we would all pitch in and take our father to the Rangers game on May 21st. To top it off my Dad had bet on the Preakness (or the other one can't remember which one was just before this game) and won some nice pocket change. The day before we went to the game I get a picture from my dad. He's bought all 6 of us City Connect jerseys, he gave me Seagers. When he gave it to me he told me to wear it as much as I could and change my luck with jerseys. He hit a home run and we beat the Rockies 13-3. When Seager got hurt literally 2 months to the day I fucking knew it. I FUCKING KNEW IT!!!! I got a text from my dad as soon as he saw it and all he said was \"keep wearing it\". \n\nI watched every. single. post season. game on the edge of my seat.

Given the Nationals' celebration of the Senators' history at Nationals Park, I believe that a Senators night is to commemorate this milestone and honor the players who represented the nation's capital for nearly a century.\n\nTo make this occasion even more special, I propose retiring Walter Johnson and Frank Howard's number. Although Mr. Johnson never wore a number while playing or managing in Washington, he wore the number 30 during an Army-Navy Relief Drive pitching to Babe Ruth in August 1942. No one who played for Washington in the five years before 1942 wore that number, with Bob Johnson wearing it in the 1943 season. As you know, both Mr. Johnson and Mr. Howard are already honored with a statue at Nationals Park as well as being part of the Ring of Honor. Retiring a player's number from a prior team is not unprecedented, as demonstrated by the unofficial retiring of Johnny Unitas' #19 by the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nI believe that retiring the two men's number would make this occasion even more special and honor one of the best pitchers to have ever played, if not the best. Following the retirement of Mr. Ryan Zimmerman's number last season, the first National League National to receive such an honor, I believe it is time to extend this great privilege to Walter Johnson and Frank Howard.", "date": "20231030", "sentiment": 0.9954}, {"ranking": 0.05172413793103448, "comments": "Do you remember where you were four years ago today?

In terms of bwar we had profar at -1.9, castro at -1.5, toglia at -1.5, bryant at -1, daza at -.4. If you had replacement level guys in castro and profar's places you probably don't lose 100 games. (not that it matters) the common denominators between these 2 (as well as daza and bryant) were lack of pop. [Park factors suggest that getting the ball in the gap is a good thing at Coors.](https://imgur.com/a/FTzrLSG)\n\nNow to compare him to Castro, Newman, when he's right, [hits a lot of these.](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/sporty-videos?playId=b95424e3-67bc-4ef3-9d3f-086260ca5a8a) Getting a guy like this who can [run a little](https://imgur.com/a/uYkHbrD) and have him squeeze out a few more bases could be a great rally starter. When compared to castro he has a similar batted ball profile (EV, HardHit, GB%) but [pulls a lot of liners for extra bases](https://imgur.com/a/XRnbB1C). This profile plays at coors, guys like arenado made their living here by pulling a ton of line drives. **PULLED FLY BALLS AND LINERS ARE THE BEST BATTED BALLS** and Newman has a penchant for it. Other things of note is Newman struck out almost half as much as Castro last year and walked twice as often in 20 less PA. He is also a fantastic shortstop, although has had issues defensively since switching to a utility role. However that takes nothing away from the fact that he nearly won the gold glove in '21. \n\nTo summarize Newman does a lot of things well on the diamond to make up for his lack of raw pop. A probable 50th percentile outcome is a wrc+ around 85, worst case close to 60, best case around 105-110 range. He is a contact bat who profiles as a sort of Nolan lite, meaning lower EVs and more grounders but lots of balls in play and liners to the pull side, something we've seen play at coors for years. He plays a great middle infield and with time could adjust better to a bench role and if either Tovar or BRod misses significant time I have a lot more confidence in him filling in than anyone currently in the organization.

See what you\u2019re not thinking of, is losing\u2026. your love.\n\nYou see the biggest victim of the pitch clock wasn\u2019t batters, pitchers, spectators, or beer sales, it was walk-up songs. Every time Chuck and his magnificent beard come up to bat, you only hear the first few notes of the hit song \u201cYour Love\u201d. If we\u2019re lucky we get 1 refrain of \u201cI just wanna use your love\u201d, but we never make it to the 2nd instance where the song importantly states: \u201cI DON\u2019T WANNA LOSE your love\u201d.\n\nThe team needs this verbal reminder that they don\u2019t want to lose multiple times per game, but they don\u2019t get it. This causes them to play like they DO want to lose, leading to the most losses in franchise history (so far). The only solution would be to play \u201cYour Love\u201d at every single tv timeout.

As someone who considers themselves almost a degen gambler let try and explain what it means and why I think it is significant.\n\nI cant remember what the Rangers opened up as but I know the Dodgers opened up as +120 favorites, so it isnt really surprising their odds are down to -110 at the moment considering many teams have backed up from the sweep stakes. What is significant is the Jays improvement throughout the time period.\n\nWhen the line opened up the Jays were not in top 10 contention, now they sit top 3. That means either a significant amount of behind the scenes knowledge has been picked up, which is suggested by the likes of Jeff Passan and the like. \n\nWhat it could also mean is sharp money has come down on Toronto significantly over the last week and a half(like a significant amount of money, enough for Vegas to move the line drastically. In this case it has to be a combination of the two, it makes no sense that a team would move up that fast that  quick when other teams are still reportedly in the sweep stakes. The Jays over jumped the Cubs who are still talking about making a significant push.\n\nWhats interesting to note is, this does mean something. Certain times throughout the year you will hear about extreme sharp money and vegas odds will shift dramatically, if any of you follow the NFL Travon Walker odds on draft day literally jumped like +350 to -2500 in like a day and a half right before the draft to be the number one overall pick.

This is the 3rd post out of 4 in this series and today we're going to go over infielders, specifically 3rd base because the non-3rd basemen in this FA class are complete and utter buns (I do have a small piece on the non-3B infielders at the end of this post). Initially I had planned on doing infielders &amp; DHs in this installment, but it got a little long so now I'll include them in the outfielders post. Just a disclaimer before we jump in: I talk a lot more about hitting peripherals like exit velocity and spray distribution than I do WAR or any of the other results-based stats. The current results are still really important, but I feel that when we're looking at trying to predict future results and find value on the margins, it's more important to understand the process of how the current results came to be rather than the current results themselves. \n\n\n**The Chapman / Candelario Contention:** The internet has played host to some legendary debates over its time: Goku vs Superman (Supes clears), Edward vs Jacob (that one was settled when Jacob basically set up an arranged marriage with Bella's baby, HOW did they think that was a good idea??), and that one [bodybuilding.com thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eECjjLNAOd4) where the guys argue over how many days are in a week. However, none of these arguments have taken over r/torontobluejays like Chapman vs Candelario. Let's dive in:\n\n\n**Matt Chapman:** The Chapman argument basically boils down to 2 key points: Hitting Peripherals &amp; Defense. The defense hasn't been \"This is the best defender in the league\" level since 2021, but 12 Defensive Runs Saved &amp; 4 Outs Above Average in 2023 are both still excellent. On the offensive side of the ball, his exit velocities (one of the best predictors of in-game power we have) and hard-hit rate (the rate at which you hit batted balls 95+ MPH) were off the charts (98th &amp; 100th percentile respectively). He also did a really excellent job of getting the ball in the air where you can make the most of those high exit velocities to really do damage. His Barrel %, defined by Statcast as \"the % of batted balls with the perfect combination of exit velocity and launch angle\" was also in the 98th percentile of the league. \n\n\nSo what gives? If he's elevating the ball with power better than anyone in baseball, why did he only hit 17 HRs in 2023? The answer lies in the distribution of where those batted balls were hit. [Here's a chart of all the Matt Chapman flyballs in 2023 that had an exit velocity over 95 MPH and a launch angle between 20 and 40 degrees](https://i.imgur.com/BKqy4Z2.png) (aka Juicy Flyballs). There's almost nothing on the pull side of the diamond! It's insane! Compare that to his [2022](https://i.imgur.com/4lj6rBs.png) and [2021](https://i.imgur.com/AM5iBQI.png) data. There's still a clustering of outs in CF in 2022, but he's still pulled the majority of these flyballs. I think that it's safe to assume that he has some positive regression coming for him in terms of power production. Chapman does still have some additional red flags: he's been a streaky hitter for almost his entire career, &amp; he's more vulnerable than most to getting beat in the strike zone (78.1% zone contact rate last year, anything below 80% is pretty rough).\n\n\n**Jeimer Candelario:** The arguments that I've seen around Candelario are that he'll give you equal production with the bat for less money, while also being less of a commitment long-term so one of the Barger / Martinez / Palmegiani contingent can take over when the time is right. Outs Above Average thinks Candelario is about an average defender for his career, while Defensive Runs Saved think he's one of the worst 3B in the game today (defensive metrics are weird). Interestingly, with the bat he's kind of the polar opposite of Chapman. He doesn't hit the ball terribly hard, but he's pretty consistent and difficult to beat in the zone (87% zone contact rate). He also elevates the ball at a fair rate, and Candelario makes the most out of these flyballs by pulling nearly all of them ([here's his spray chart in 2023 using the same metrics that I used for Chapman's](https://i.imgur.com/4mUYdli.png)) which is primarily what allowed him to overperform his xWOBA last season (.346 vs .319). On these Juicy Flyballs, his WOBA was over 1.200 whereas Chapman's was .781 which is absolutely massive. There's a lot to like about Candelario and I think it's more likely that his -0.1 WAR 2022 was the outlier rather than his 3.3 WAR 2023. \n\n\nUltimately however, I land on the side that not bringing back Chapman will make the team worse. The money on his new deal might not look good in year 5 but the Jays are currently in their compete window and not bringing back the best player available on the market at his position is a mistake, especially when everything points to positive regression in the near future. Candelario is a fine player, but I just think that his bat is more susceptible to negative regression if his batted ball distribution changes, and his glove isn't going to make up any of that value if he does struggle. I also don't think Barger, Martinez or Palmegiani are long term fits at 3rd or going to make a real impact in 2024. They all seem as though they're destined for the other side of the diamond or a corner outfield spot (out of the 3, I'm probably the highest on Martinez. I'm a big fan of the walk rate, raw power, &amp; batted ball profile) so in my opinion, inking Chapman long term doesn't block anyone. Candelario is miles better than any of the non-Chapman options though, and if Chapman decides to go to San Francisco or Seattle, I would welcome him with open arms.\n\n\nOf course there is a Doomer scenario where the Jays don't end up with EITHER of these guys, so in order to prematurely stop r/torontobluejays from collectively throwing themselves off a bridge, let's look at the other options at 3rd base. DISCLAIMER: THESE ARE ALL BAD OPTIONS!!! I've committed myself to writing about this awful hitter class and trying to find the best value for next year, but if the Jays don't land either of the top 2 guys they should try and make a move for a real guy (Ezequiel Duran, J.D Davis, Jared Triolo, Kyle Farmer, etc). I don't really believe in the Jean Segura revival either!! But it's a hell of a lot better than trying to convince myself that Josh Harrison has still got that dog in him. That being said, let's plug our noses and rummage through the bargain bin:\n\n\n**Gio Urshela:** Does the name Gio Urshela do anything for you in 2023? If not then you're really going to have a hard time with the rest of this list because he's clearly the 3rd best player who can man the hot corner in this class. Urshela is coming off of his worst season since his 2019 breakout: he only played 62 games due to a fractured pelvis and posted his lowest wRC+ (92) since 2019. His walk rate was down, his chase rate was up, and he was already someone that didn't walk much and chased a lot. His hard hit rate and exit velocities were both down as well, which severely limited his SLG. \n\n\nOk, so what's the upside here? How is he still clearly the 3rd best option despite all of these flaws? Well, even with everything that went wrong, his wRC+ was within sniffing distance of league average and he's only a year removed from a 2022 where he played 144 games and carried a 119 wRC+. The exit velocities dropping are the most concering aspect to me considering how sticky those numbers are, but he still hits a lot of line drives and the 3.6% HR/FB ratio definitely isn't sustainable over a full season with what his exit velocities were in 2023. He's like the bathroom at a Gas Station in the middle of nowhere of 3B options: you should have planned ahead and gone before you got in the car or before you left the city, but it still provides you the relief you need in a pinch.\n\n\n**Jean Segura:** Segura &amp; Urshela are actually pretty similar players but if Urshela had a bad year, then Segura had the Year From Hell. After posting a 105 wRC+ in 98 games with the Phillies in 2022, he accumulated -1.3 WAR, 52 wRC+ and was released by the Marlins on August 1st in 2023. That's probably as close as you can get to achieving the polar opposite of winning the triple crown. For someone to get so bad so quickly, surely his peripheral hitting stats matched the decline of his counting stats. Walks &amp; Ks are one of the easiest ways to see if someone's declining, and so it makes sense that his walk rate went... up (6.5 -&gt; 6.7) and his K rate went... down (15.0 -&gt; 14.4). Hmm that's weird, well then clearly when he actually hit the ball he was just making worse contact. His average exit velocity went from 87.6 all the way down to... 88 and his hard-hit rate declined from 38.4 down to... 38.8. Ok, well what does the batted ball distribution look like, did he just start hitting easy flyballs and pop-ups that had no chance of becoming hits? His Line Drive rate dropped 1.4% and his flyball rate hasn't really changed, so other than a 5% increase in infield pop-ups (which wouldn'd drop his wRC+ by 50 points), the distribution looks the same as it was his entire career when he averaged nearly 3 WAR per season. I think Segura just had an extremely weird season, I don't expect him to be an All-Star again, but I think he's the most obvious candidate for positive regression out of all of these guys.\n\n\n**Josh Donaldson:** Ok this one isn't going to happen because of all of the baggage with the Blue Jays (and because he's an asshole), but speaking of weird seasons, Donaldson had an all-timer and I really want to write about it: .115 BABIP? Not what you want! Becoming the most hated Yankee since Jacoby Ellsbury? Kinda based if you think about it. Not introducing himself to his teammates in Milwaukee because he thought \"Everybody knows who I am\"? Hilarious, but in a \"laughing at you, not with you\" kind of way. Unforunately, the sneaky truth is that despite all of this, the not-so-young man can still play. He walks at an above average clip, still has upper tier exit velocities and is an above average defender at the hot corner. He's not going to be a high batting average guy going forward because of his diminished contact %s and flyball-heavy approach, but he's also not going to be Old Joey Gallo and live below the Mendoza line (his 8.5% line drive rate in 2023 is the primary culprit and that isn't sustainable over a full season). I think whoever picks him up for his final season will be pleasantly surprised on the field (maybe not so much off of it) as a Gallo-esque-except-better-contact-skills type hitter, especially compared to what's out there in the FA market.\n\n\n**The Other 3rd Basemen:** Evan Longoria, Brian Anderson, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Kevin Newman, Adalberto Mondesi, Eduardo Escobar, Joey Wendle, Jonathan Schoop, Josh Harrison, Hanser Alberto, Tommy La Stella, Nick Senzel, Garret Hampson, Matt Duffy, Harold Castro, Luis Guillorme, Michael Chavis, Ehire Adrianza, Hunter Dozier\n\n\nAll of these guys are either old (I still love you Longo), can't hit (don't worry guys, this is the IKF breakout year), have glaring red flags in their peripherals (sorry Garret Hampson, he of the .379 BABIP), or are all of the above (Adrianza didn't deserve this stray, I hope he has a good life). Some of them might get picked up, but it's hard to see them as anything more than an extra bench bat, a pseudo-bench coach or a 2024 KBO All-Star.\n\n\n**The Non-3rd Basemen:** Tim Anderson, Adam Frazier, Amed Rosario, Enrique Hernandez, Tony Kemp, Brandon Crawford, Elvis Andrus, Whit Merrifield, Kolten Wong, Roughned Odor, Jose Iglesias, Nick Ahmed, Harold Castro, Jake Lamb, Leury Garcia, Eric Hosmer, Wil Myers, Brad Miller, Jesus Aguilar, Jared Walsh, Mike Moustakas\n\n\nThe Jays are pretty set around the diamond other than the hot corner so I wasn't planning on dwelling to much on these additional infielders. Then I looked at some of the names that are available up the middle and at 1B and realized: I don't think I could write about these guys even if the Jays had a positional need here. Honestly I'm just happy for Whit, if anyone has a need for a 2nd baseman (Boston) they almost have to pay him over market, there's just nobody good that's available. He's the only one other than Crawford, Hernandez &amp; Rosario who's even been somewhat good since 2021. There is one name that intrigues me though, so I'll do a quick blurb since he seems to be getting some traction in the sub. \n\n\n**Amed Rosario:** Rosario is one of the youngest players in this FA class and had back to back above average offensive seasons (102 &amp; 105 wRC+ at Shortstop) before faltering in 2023. He's never been one to get his steps in (4.5% career walk rate), but there aren't really any red flags in any of the other peripherals. His exit velocities were consistent &amp; hard hit rate actually improved compared to his previous seasons and he even began elevating more. Despite this, his HR/FB rate dropped below 5% for the first time in his career, so you can probably expect some positive offensive regression. \n\n\nThe issue is that Rosario is a Shortstop, not a Third Basemen. Luckily, Rosario is not a particularly good Shortstop (-53 OAA in 7 seasons!!) so it made sense to me that he would likely have to move to either 2nd or 3rd in order to find his long-term defensive home. Even below average defenders at Short often move to other positions and become plus defenders, so it seemed as though the Jays might be able to scoop him up and move him over to 3rd. That is until I looked at said list of FA middle infielders. I urge you not to go over the list again because it might hurt your eyes but trust me when I say that it is dire. So because of that, I'm confident that SOMEONE who has a need in the middle of their infield will pay him to play Shortstop, no matter how below average he is, just because of the age and the regression potential of the bat. If I'm wrong then he would vault into 3rd place on this list pretty quickly. \n\n\nI hope you enjoyed this post, I feel like I need a shower after looking at Tim Anderson's Fangraphs page. I'll try and bring back a fun gimmick for the outfielders, there was just so much to cover here that I felt like I needed to dive right in.

Leones del Escogido aren't far behind, having recently got hot with the mid-season addition of MLB star Jose Ramirez, pulling past Toros del Este for the final playoff spot.

Tigres won the league championship in 2022-23, and went on to represent the Domincan Republic and win the Caribbean Series. Recently, the two teams sold out Citi Field in New York for a weekend of exhibition baseball. That it was exhibition is unfortunate for \u00c1guilas, as they swept Tigres 3-0 in a season where wins have been scare for the team.

Some people might not think that, ownership or FO might agree, but the reality is he was on pace for somewhere between 5.5-6 Bwar pre injury. He has improved defensively every season though his range is still below average. Bichette has improved offensively basically every season.(the last month of his year was skewed by coming off injury) He also has lead the AL in hits the last two seasons and still finished top 5 this season with missing around 30 games. There is a very good chance he improves further both defensively and offensively. \n\nThat right there is a 300 million dollar player.

(Aside from a joke about appetizers that completely flopped; no restaurants will be named in the rest of this post I promise!) Today's post will focus on relief pitchers and boy are there a fuck ton of them (over 80!). Because reliever performance can be so random year to year and there are so many names and guys that nobody knows, it's almost impossible to divide them into tiers like I did with starters. \n\n\nSo instead of ranking these baseball players entirely by their skill or by how much money they might earn, I'm going to classify the available relievers based on another group of unreliable men that are hard to distinguish from one another: **Guys You Might See on Hinge** (colloquially referred to as Hinge Boys). Similar to the last post, I'll make sure that every reliever is assigned to a classification, but I'll only do write-ups for the players that I really like. Let's jump right in!\n\n\n**Blue Jays Need at this Position:** At least 1 consistent bullpen arm (but you can never have too many!)\n\n\n**The Standout Hot Guy:** This is the guy who appears in the Standouts section: he's objectively hot, he's got a cute dog, he's got really nice travel pictures, his prompts even say that he goes to therapy! You immediately send him a like with a comment, you might even use your rose for the week. Unfortunately, there are 29 other people who have done the exact same thing and some of them just have more to offer.\n\n\nBaseball Translation: This guy is a consistent back-end weapon. No notes. \n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Josh Hader*\n\n\nHe's really awesome but if the Jays spend $20M a year on a reliever with the holes that are currently on the roster, I will literally KMS (Keep Myself Safe). \n\n\n\n**The Cute Guy with Good Prompts:** This guy isn't as objectively hot as the Standout Hot Guy, but he dresses well, has pictures that are clear and well-lit, and you can tell that he put real effort into his prompts. If you think he's cute you'll definitely send him a message but even if he's not your flavour of guy, but he'll definitely find someone on the apps.\n\n\nBaseball Translation: Quality ML bullpen contributors. You should feel great about adding any one of these guys to your arm barn.\n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Hector Neris, Dylan Floro, Brent Suter, Phil Maton, Joe Kelly, Emilio Pagan, Scott Alexander, Jordan Hicks, Will Smith, Wandy Peralta*\n\n\nPhil Maton: At first glance, Maton doesn't look like he'd profile as a consistent back-end reliever: he barely touches 90 MPH with his fastball and gets virtually no carry on it. However despite the lack of velocity, Maton is an absolute spin monster (99th percentile according to Baseball Savant). That spin doesn't lead to much carry on the fastball due to the extreme cut that he throws it with (Pitch Classification models call it a 4-seamer but it's essentially a cutter), but it does allow him to throw some truly disgusting breaking balls. He's cut his fastball usage over the years and is throwing both the Sweeper and Curveball more than ever. The result of this is maintaining a respectable strikeout rate while generating weak contact better than almost anyone in baseball. The lack of velocity has also allowed Maton to be incredibly durable, he's thrown at least 65 innings in each of the 3 seasons and would be my #1 target for the Jays to fill the Jordan Hicks sized hole in the bullpen. \n\n\nDylan Floro / Scott Alexander: I've grouped Floro and Alexander here because they are incredibly similar arms: they both avoid the barrel of the bat pretty well and generate a ton of groundball contact. Personally I would put Floro slightly ahead due to the additional swing &amp; miss in his profile (about league average k% whereas Alexander is definitively below average). Neither of these guys are going to shut the world down but they're both guys you'd feel good about handing the ball to 50 times in a season. \n\n\n\n**The Hot Guy Who Only Has 1 Outfit:** This guy looks like he belongs in the Standout tier when you first come across his profile, he's fit and has a great smile. However, as you swipe through his profile you realize that all of his pictures were clearly taken on the same day: he has the same outfit in all of them and the location looks similar. He still looks good, but it begs the question: where are the other pictures, what is he hiding?\n\n\nBaseball Translation: This guy had a really good season last year, but teams will be gambling on whether or not it's sustainable year-over-year. Unsurprisingly, it's almost all Dodgers &amp; Rays relievers.\n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Robert Stephenson, Ryan Brasier, Shelby Miller, Jake Diekman, Jay Jackson, Keynan Middleton*\n\n\nShelby Miller: An under the radar Immaculate Grid guy after his rookie breakout with the Cardinals (8 teams in 11 seasons), Miller bounced around the league for a while before landing with the Dodgers last year. There he reinvented himself by leaning more heavily into the fastball and adding a pretty good Splitter which took over the role of his best secondary pitch from his Slider. The fastball is the real star of the show though, from a pitch design perspective its everything you want out of a 4-seamer (above average carry with elite extension from a relatively low slot) and it provides him with an excellent baseline to attack any hitter up in the zone. Health is really the only issue here, as 2023 was the first time he's thrown more than 40 innings since 2019, and only the 2nd time he's done it since 2016. If the Jays can ink him to a low base contract with performance incentives, it could potentially be a super high-upside move.\n\n\nKeynan Middleton: Normally I would be very hesitant about a guy who's K &amp; GB rates spiked without the quality of stuff changing at all, but I think Middleton is the outlier here. He really embraced the \"throw your best pitches more\" philosophy and essentially swapped his changeup &amp; fastball usage (the changeup went from 17% all the way up to 42%!) His changeup had always done a good job of keeping the ball on the ground and getting whiffs, but it's truly impressive that he was able to maintain those qualities while throwing the pitch more than twice as often as his career rate. I don't think that will translate into him being a true talent 30% K / 56% GB guy, but because it's a pitch mix change it at least feels like getting close to those numbers is much more sustainable.\n\n\n\n**The Tall Guy with Red Flags in the Bio:** This guy looks alright until as you swipe through his profile you notice something: he's listed himself as 6'5. You throw on your rose-tinted glasses and scan the rest of his profile: his controversial opinion is that he hates animals and he uses the word \"females\" to describe women. It's not ideal but hey, maybe he's just being sarcastic and is actually a normal guy IRL. \n\n\nBaseball Translation: These guys all have an outlier trait or attribute that make them enticing along with a major flaw or uncertainty. If everything breaks right they could be incredible, or it could go very poorly. \n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Aroldis Chapman, Craig Kimbrel, Shintaro Fujinami, Yuki Matsui*\n\n\nChapman &amp; Kimbrel looked dreadful in the playoffs but the stuff is good enough to entice a bunch of different teams. Matsui is a bit small and relatively unknown, Fujinami has absolutely electric stuff but could barely hit the broad side of a barn last year. Personally this entire tier is No Touch in my opinion. \n\n\n\n**Algorithm Filler:** These are the guys where nothing is wrong with their profiles, but there's just nothing interesting about them either. They like to go hiking and watch the Office and have a group picture where you can't tell which one is the actual guy from the profile. Their entire existence just goes in one ear and out the other as you swipe.\n\n\nBaseball Translation: Middle relief guys that can handle low leverage innings that you often forget are even on the team. I made one of the names below up and I bet you'd have no idea which one it is unless you checked Fangraphs. \n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Chris Stratton, Trevor Gott, Matt Moore, Buck Farmer, Chris Devenski, Andrew Chafin, Carl Edwards Jr., Derek Law, Chasen Shreve, Luis Garcia, Michael Tonkin, Matt Jefferson, Ryne Stanek, Jose Cisnero, Joely Rodriguez, John Curtiss, Richard Bleier, Drew Verhagen, John Brebbia, Albert Abreu, Brett Martin*\n\n\nJohn Brebbia: The thing about algorithm filler is that every once in a while you find a pretty great guy who just has no idea how to market himself. As a baseball reliever, that's John Brebbia. You had no idea who John Brebbia was until you read this blurb, hell I didn't know who he was until I started doing this list. He's the physical embodiment of the \"Eckerton, I like Eckerton. You don't even know who Eckerton is\" line from Moneyball. He's a fastball/slider guy (even his profile blends in) who gets pretty excellent carry on the fastball and a good amount of whiffs on the slider. He's not going to blow your socks off, but he's an above average bullpen arm that has the Kuroko Tetsuya power of nobody noticing him, which means that the Jays might be able to pick him up for pretty cheap.\n\n\n\n**Old Guy Looking for a Younger Girl:** This is the guy who's in his early to mid 40's with no kids who set his age filter all the way down to exclusively 24 &amp; 25 year olds. It's not illegal and some 24 &amp; 25 year olds are into that sort of thing but something about it just feels weird and off-putting.\n\n\nBaseball Translation: Older Guys past their prime, looking to squeeze 1 or 2 more good seasons for cheap before they retire. \n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Bryan Shaw, Jesse Chavez, Collin McHugh, Aaron Loup, Daniel Hudson, Adam Ottavino, Brad Boxberger, Zach McAllister, Tommy Hunter, Ryan Tepera, Drew Pomeranz, Mark Melancon*\n\n\nThis pitching staff would have kicked ass in 2014 but personally I feel like if you're going to try to sign a bullpen depth option, you should try and go for a little bit more upside.\n\n\n\n**Bad Pics with Bad Prompts:** These guys aren't algorithm filler because they're memorable in the worst way. Fish Picture! Shirtless Mirror Selfie! Ack! Let's go to the next tier already. \n\n\nBaseball Translation: I'm not sure all these guys even make it onto a roster next year. Get ready to learn Japanese, buddy!\n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Austin Adams, Matt Barnes, Jacob Barnes, Nick Wittgren, Shane Greene, Anthony Bass, Tyler Duffey, Mychal Givens, Amir Garrett, Erasmo Ramirez, Jeurys Familia, Tim Hill, Matt Bush, Jorge Lopez*\n\n\nFuck Anthony Bass!!!\n\n\n\n**The Guy with No Bio:** This guy is truly an enigma, he's relying solely on his looks to try and make an impression. He could be in MENSA or he could think that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the lost cinematic masterpiece of the late 2000's. There's just no way to know unless you start talking to him.\n\n\nBaseball Translation: These guys were hurt or barely pitched last year, the true lottery tickets of the bunch. \n\n\n*Players in this Tier: Josh Staumont, Sam Coonrod, Adam Cimber, Victor Arano, Jimmy Nelson, Justin Wilson, Lou Trivino, Jarlin Garcia, Alex Reyes, Codi Heuer, Liam Hendriks, Penn Murfee*\n\n\nJosh Staumont: Staumont was hurt for most of last year but when he's right his stuff is as electric as it gets. 97 MPH with mouth-watering cut/ride shape, complimented by an absolute hammer of a breaking ball with nearly 2700 RPMs of spin and above average velocity (82 MPH). He's always had trouble finding the zone consistently, but between Robbie Ray &amp; Genesis Cabrera, it seems like those kinds of guys are Pete Walker's specialty. If he can get right, he'd be an incredible addition to the back end of the bullpen.\n\n\nPenn Murfee: Murfee is going to be out for half of this season due to TJ surgery, so if you were going to sign him then you'd probably want to do a Chad Green style deal with options &amp; incentives. When Murfee is right, he's a side-arm sweeper specialist with a really unique fastball (it's basically at the 0 line in terms of horizontal movement with almost no carry). He's excellent at coaxing weak contact and was one of the best relievers in the league with Seattle in 2022. Definitely a guy who you'd like to add in the back half of a potential playoff push.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed my attempt to make reliever signings seem a little more enjoyable, especially considering how much of a crapshoot they generally are. The next group of players that I'm going to tackle in this series will be infielders &amp; DHs (specifically focusing on 3B and DH since those are the main positions of need). I know this is a hot point of discussion right now so I'll try and get the part out before any of the big signings happen.\n\n\nAll data used was taken from Fangraphs, Baseball Savant, &amp; mlbpitchprofiler.com", "date": "20231125", "sentiment": 0.9995}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Unbeatable Baseball Records ", "date": "20231126", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Interesting SABR article about Blue Jays' ownership history ", "date": "20231125", "sentiment": 0.4019}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Off-Season Nonsense: Time For Baseball To Give The People What They Want!

First off it has been a blast and i will forever cherish that experience. I didn t mind the Rain whatsoever. We didn t go by Plane, we went by Bus (can t remember the Route) but to hastings with Ferry and everything it took 16 Hours and back home almost 17 Hours. Still worth every damn second! When we went past Buckingham Palace on that one day in the week we staysed doing a Tour, the driver said jokingly: \"If you look to your right, you can see the Queen of England waving at the window!\" I will never forget that. Now to my Question. I don t remmber what day it was that we did the trip trough London with Madame Tussauds, Tower, Londond eye, HMS Belfast etc but i know the Week.\n\n1. Is it possible for me to somehow find out if the Queen was at Buckingham Palace in at that time in the wek? Because i just wanna find out myself if i actually was \"kind of close to her\" atleast once in my life. And with her Passing i felt a bigger Urge to find out. But not how. We Started with out trip from Home on Sunday, November 2nd and arrived on the Fishmarket in London relativley late. So if she was there only one day of the week before we left on Friday taht would be cool. :)\n2. I have watched a Documentary about a certain \"Person\" that i didn t know before by the Name of Jimmy Savile (sorry if i butchered that name). He was made a Sir. What i want to know is, is it possible for example for Charles to Remove a Title like that off of him or can only the Royal of gave the title do that? And can it be removed after the Passing of Jimmy?\n3. Is it possible for a Royal to give the Power to the next in Line due to Health issues or any other reason. Like the King (god forbid, i hope he has atleast a life as long as the Queen) maing Willing the new King of England? Or is there a certain Ruling that it can only be done after the Passing of the last Kind or Queen?\n4. With Charles being king. If he was to pass, would Camilla take over or have some sort of Power? Or is it just going over to William? And how important of a Role would Camilla or Kate have when it comes to ruling?\n\nThats all that i want to know so far. I hope that you stay strong during these hard times. The Queen for sure will also be missed by me personally. She did have this humor that i enjoyed. Especially the moment with Harry vs the Obamas making fun of their \"Mic drop\" :) Or the Time her former Chef explainedhow he encountered her and didn t realize, her corgies ran towards him, he turned to run away and heard her laughing. Things like that are briliant. Just seeing how much she experienced, traveled and did is just imprssive. Recently i head, that there are over 3000 Charities the Royals and especially her took care of. Jst Mindblowing if thats true I try to see it in a positive way, that she sool will be reunited with her Phillip and lives on in our hearts &lt;3\n\nThank you and Stay strong", "date": "20220910", "sentiment": 0.9981}, {"ranking": 0.10344827586206896, "comments": "In memory of the passing of Queen Elizabeth the II queen you lived an amazing life and no one will ever forget you GOD SAVE THE QuEEN, GOD SAVE THE KING ", "date": "20220910", "sentiment": 0.9352}, {"ranking": 0.10344827586206896, "comments": "Thank u for everything you have done for us .

I'm completely disregarding the thought of \"oh America was founded by giving the finger to the royal family\" as I see that as a wak argument.\n\nI knew from day 1 that megs just would not work as a duchess.\n\nI was happy for her when she found Prince Harry, I knew she'd be happy with him, but if several years have taught me one thing about her, Megs does not hold back, and when you are in th eroyal family, you can't be political at all.\n\nBefore you go flaming and shaming at me, I want to put you in this scenario.\n\nIf I told you that you must from this point on not be political, you have to keep all opinions that can be seen as controvercial to yourself no matter what lest you bring shame and doubt upon the family's name, what would you do?\n\nThe royal family's posh traditionalist ideals are in direct conflict with Meghan's feminist, racial activist and California USA ideals.  This is not about her race, but rather about her ideals vs. the royal ideals.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI honestly think that it would have been better for Prince Harry to have left royal duties before marrying Meghan, then this way he could guaranty that the two could be happy together as a couple while still letting Meghan have full freedom to speak her mind and be herself, and not some molded ideal of a time long past.\n\nNow you could argue that she could have represented change, but I honestly do not think Megs would have been a second Princess Diana..\n\nWhen you try to expand something it's better to use tools to work at it and more effectively make it bigger and better.\n\nMeghan does not prepresent this as Princess Dianna did.  Rather Meghan essentially was more of putting a bomb in the center of the thing then hoping to make it bigger by blowing the walls apart.\n\nThis is based on Meghan's strong opinions and vastly vastly different ideals than the royal family.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Diana's ideals were different too, but not so much so that they would have represented a bomb of different ideals.\n\nSo honestly, I'm glad that Meghan and Prince Harry left because it allows them to be happier in their lives.\n\nRoyal life is not for everyone and unfortunately, this includes Meghan Markle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThoughts?\n\nPS, I know she is dutchess blah blah blah, but given how I knew her, I'll always know her as Megs, she never ojected to me calling her that.", "date": "20200111", "sentiment": 0.995}, {"ranking": 0.10344827586206896, "comments": "'His sweat was like it was raining': Prince Andrew's accuser gives tell-all interview | ABC News ", "date": "20191229", "sentiment": 0.3612}, {"ranking": 0.10344827586206896, "comments": "Duke and Duchess of Sussex looking into moving to Canada?

Which is Queen in Latin. That doesn't mean that it's her last name. Another example (from male monarchs within her life), her father King George VI signed with R which means Rex or King in Latin. Her uncle The Duke of Windsor or aka Edward VIII even though he was not coronated yet, was already King, signed with RI which means King Emperor in Latin.\n\nHer last name is Windsor (and so does her immediate descendants excluding the wives/partners but, that's a different topic).\n\nSo, basically when she signs it means Elizabeth The Queen. It doesn't mean that Regina is part of her name, the same case for R or RI when it's male monarchs. Queen Victoria signed the same way: VR.

I hope you have a safe commute this morning. It's starting to get cold out on us. Before we start today's discussion on starting pitching, I am no expert by any means. I'm a lifelong Cubs fan who happened to play baseball through college. I don't have some fancy credentials like a former major leaguer or manager. I love the game like the rest of you all.\n\nLet's dive into what 2023 gave us for starting pitching. I'm basing this discussion on Games Started, ERA, innings pitched, and our good old newer WAR. I will use anyone who gave us ten starts or more, equivalent to just over 16 percent of our games this season.\n\nFirst and foremost, Marcus Stroman did opt out and is now a free agent, leaving us with a hole in our rotation, but the Professor will be back for another season. We all know the Cubbies threw the entire world for a loop and did some gangster shit by signing Craig Counsell, who ultimately decides who's who when it comes to one through five. Therefore, we'll leave the \u201cAce\u201d title unclaimed for now and discuss the rotation.\n\nJustin Steele led the team with thirty starts for the season, turning in 173 1/3 innings of 3.06 ERA ball. He was dominant most of the season, but as I watched, I think he got worn out toward the season's end. In my personal opinion, he does have the mound presence to be our Ace and a damn good one when he gets another dominant season under his belt.\n\nNext up is Jameson, and no, not the liquor, even though I think Jed may have been drunk during this signing. Tailion gave us twenty-nine starts, equaling 154 1/3 innings pitched of 4.84 ERA hell. He was a true Jekyll and Hyde pitcher for the team, looking good or looking like the BP pitcher getting shit on by prime Josh Hamilton in Yankee Stadium. In this contract, I think we will have to eat it, but in my opinion, he needs to be on the back end of the rotation.\n\nNext up would be what to replace twenty-five starts of 136.2 innings pitched with a 3.95 ERA with. There are plenty of top-tier options out there to be signed. Let\u2019s discuss Blake Snell, the newly crowned NL Cy Young Award winner who was one of the few bright spots for the Padres. Do I even need to discuss why this needs to happen? Two Cy Youngs, two ERA titles, and will be 31 years old at the season's start. It will take a good amount of cash to lure him in, but what about short-term with a higher AAV? A contract with four years, somewhere around 120-130 million, definitely sounds fair, in my opinion. Aaron Nola is also another free-agent option but has been a career-long Phillie. He may take a little more persuasion, especially with the team that\u2019s been built and can win again this season. The trade market has a lot of intriguing options like Tyler Glasnow, Shane Bieber, or, intriguingly, former Cub Dylan Cease. \n\nTo round out the rest of the starters from this season, Drew Smyly, Javier Assad, and Hayden Wesneski all contributed ten starts or more. Personally, Assad looks like a future rotation piece, and Wesneski looks like a spot starter or long relief piece the Cubs may utilize. What are your thoughts, my fellow North Sider fans?

As the team looks to solidify its future and continue its winning tradition, one player that should be on their radar is Japanese phenom Yamamoto. With his incredible skill set, impressive track record, and the potential to become a game-changer, signing Yamamoto could be a game-changing move for the Cardinals.\n\n1. An Impressive Track Record:\nYamamoto has had an outstanding career in Japan's professional baseball league, excelling with 3 straight MVPs, His impressive track record includes numerous accolades, such as multiple All-Star selections and a championship title. Yamamoto's ability to perform at a high level consistently demonstrates his reliability and competitiveness, making him an ideal addition to the Cardinals' roster.\n\n2. Versatile Skill Set:\nOne of the most enticing aspects of Yamamoto's game is his versatility. As a pitcher, he possesses a wide range of pitches, including a blazing fastball, a devastating slider, and a deceptive changeup. His ability to mix up his pitches keeps hitters off balance, making him an exciting addition. \n\n3. International Appeal:\nSigning Yamamoto would not only enhance the Cardinals' on-field performance but also expand their international brand. The Cardinals have a strong following in Japan, thanks to their history with Japanese players like So Taguchi, Adding Yamamoto to their roster would undoubtedly attract more attention from Japanese fans, providing an opportunity to tap into a new market and increase revenue streams.\n\n4. Youthful Energy and Long-Term Potential:\nAt just 24 years old, Yamamoto represents a long-term investment for the Cardinals. By signing him, the team would secure a player entering his prime years, with the potential for significant growth. The Cardinals have a history of developing young talent and could provide Yamamoto with the necessary support and infrastructure to fully realize his potential. His addition could inject youthful energy into the team, creating a dynamic and exciting atmosphere in the clubhouse.\n\n5. A Competitive Edge:\nAcquiring Yamamoto would give the Cardinals a competitive edge in the weakened NL Central.

Angels traded infielder Ian Kinsler to the Boston Red Sox for then 25-year old prospect pitcher, Ty Buttrey.

Then, almost a year later, he un-retired, and spent all of 2022 in the Angels Minor League system, then elected to become a Free Agent in November. Since 2023 began, he signed a Minor League deal with the Astros, spending time in their system before being released in August. Then in October, he signed on with the Leones del Escogido of the Dominic Republic Professional Baseball League.\n\nSo I call on the Angels community once again to help aid me in the 45 or so minutes that I'll have with him on an off day very soon.

This relocation saga has plagued me, my home, and my community for some time. I\u2019m from the LA area, born and raised. I went red when most everyone else in the neighborhood went Dodger blue. I got to see my team win their one and only World Series title, watched it on tv with my dad. Have continued to be a fan through all of the clubs bullshit these last almost 40 years. But now I\u2019m supposed to blindly march forward with my fandom knowing our crap owner could pull the same bullshit as John Fisher, and that MBL will without issue support it. That shit don\u2019t fly for me.\n\nI moved away from the southland to pursue college in NorCal. Been here in the east bay for some time now. My partner of 8 years is a diehard A\u2019s fan. Baseball was a cornerstone in our home; we went to every Angels/A\u2019s game when Anaheim came up to Oakland. We both hated on our respective regional rivals (her the Giants, and me the Dodgers). Being a fan of the bigger better ball clubs was easy. Being a fan of our teams was a choice and took work. That\u2019s what being an underdog is all about.\n\nWe have matching OG Starter jackets, new school Starters, matching ugly christmas sweaters, custom jerseys, hell, we have a reversable team blanket on our bed (winners team gets to have their team up for the night). Baseball is a cornerstone in our relationship, specifically Oakland baseball. I've now easily seen more games at the Coliseum than back in LA during my childhood. Local east bay baseball means a great deal to us, so we were passionate about this relocation.\n\nBut now, how am I (and even her more so) supposed to continue supporting MLB for ripping baseball away from our community, from us? I am appalled at the handling of the relocation in support of a broke billionaire that wants nothing more than free money. And to hear there are almost 7 other teams (including our own) waiting in the wings to pull the same stunt is inexcusable.\n\nThis scam professional sport teams pull for public money in exchange for our fandom is a greedy attempt of making money at the expense of the poor. These organizations and teams are asking for our hard earned dollars upfront and then stealing our wallet to further line their own pockets. How much money do these owners really need? It's an embarassment, and they should all be ashamed for supporting the distruction of our love for the game. Thanks clown-shoes Manfred, limp-dick Fisher, and everyone other owner that voted yes for ruining something so special to so many people.

These players may also be trade targets for other teams as well as we go through the offseason. Feel free to mention anyone that I left off and we can talk about their 2023 season as well. I tried to go with guys who would be considered actual prospects, so generally anyone under 25 was considered. \n\nFor reference, the Braves have 4 full season minor league teams, and a few short season league teams as well.\n\nAAA: Gwinnett Stripers\n\nAA: Mississippi Braves\n\nA+: Rome Braves\n\nA: Augusta Greenjackets\n\n**Pitchers (in no particular order)**\n\n***Spencer Schwellenbach, 23 - 16 starts, 65 IP, 2.49 ERA, 7.6 K/9, 2.2 BB/9, 4.03 xFIP (13 G at A+)***\n\nSpencer had a really nice year, but the biggest concern was his health after missing a large chunk of time with injuries. Spencer was our 2nd round pick in 2021. I think he will take another step forward in 2024 and continue to improve. His advanced pitching stats weren't quite as rosy, but still solid for sure.\n\n***Owen Murphy, 20 - 21 S, 89.2 IP, 4.72 ERA, 11.3 K/9, 3.2 BB/9, 3.47 xFIP (18 G at A)***\n\nMurphy was in his age 19 season, and had a very strong year for such a young pitcher. His ERA was a little high, but his rate stats show that he was pitching very well. Murphy is our first round pick from 2022, and I would expect him to start 2024 in A+, where he ended the season with 3 starts last year.\n\n***Jorge Bautista, 23 - 15 S (22 GP), 107 IP, 4.04 ERA, 9.3 K/9, 3.4 BB/9, 3.48 xFIP (8 G at A)***\n\nI didn't really know anything about Bautista until I started reviewing stats and noticed he quietly had a pretty solid year. It appears he was signed out of the DR as a teenager, and has been making his way through our system slowly since then. He struggled a bit when promoted to A+, but his K numbers increased as well. I would assume he starts next season at A+, unless the Braves want to challenge him and start him in AA.\n\n***JR Ritchie, 20 - 4 GS, 13.1 IP, 5.40 ERA, 16.9 K/9, 2.0 BB/9, 1.40 xFIP - A***\n\nA bit of an honorable mention here, JR was electric through 4 starts before going down with injury and eventually undergoing Tommy John surgery. He will miss a large chunk if not all of the 2024 season recovering. JR was our 3rd round pick in 2022 and I look forward to the next time he is able to get on the mound.\n\n***Cedric de Grandpre, 22 - 17 S (19 GP), 86.2 IP, 3.95 ERA, 9.1 K/9, 2.3 BB/9, 4.59 xFIP (12 G at A+)***\n\nOur very own Canadian, de Grandpre had a nice first full year in the organization (2022 13th round pick). His peripherals were a little questionable at the higher level, but he is still pretty young and has plenty of time to continue improving. He will also presumably begin 2024 at A+ or AA.\n\n***Riley Frey - 22 - 6 S, 21 IP, 5.57 ERA, 12.0 K/9, 2.6 BB/9, 2.73 xFIP (5 G at A)***\n\nThe first 2023 draftee listed (19th round), Frey was pitching at a low level but had really nice peripherals and is still fairly young. Someone to watch for 2024 for sure, and since he was a college pitcher he may be challenged with a higher level placement. I decided to include him even though he didn't pitch a ton in 2023.\n\n***Hurston Waldrep - 22 - 8 S, 29.1 IP, 1.53 ERA, 12.6 K/9, 4.9 BB/9, 4.25 xFIP (3 G at AA)***\n\nI couldn't make this list without Waldrep, who made it all the way to AAA in his first year of pro ball. There are some concerns with his control/command, as his walk rate was high, but hopefully he is able to improve that part of his game. We will see him in Atlanta at some point in 2024, barring a disaster.\n\n***Tyler Owens - 23 - 15 S (29 GP), 65.1 IP, 3.03 ERA, 9.2 K/9, 3.0 BB/9, 3.83 xFIP (15 G at A+)***\n\nOwens had a solid year, moving between starting and relieving. I think he probably projects as a reliever moving forward, and should be in AA to start 2024. He is a 19th round pick from 2019, and is still pretty young.\n\n***Lucas Braun - 22 - 6 S, 27 IP, 2.67 ERA, 10.7 K/9, 1.7 BB/9, 3.05 xFIP (4 G at A)***\n\nAnother 2023 college draftee (6th round), Braun had some nice numbers, although a small sample and at lower level of competition. Hopefully the Braves start him at AA to begin the year. He is also still fairly young so there could be some projectability to him.\n\n***Hayden Harris - 25 - 40 GP, 59.1 IP, 4.10 ERA, 13.8 K/9, 3.6 BB/9, 3.44 xFIP (23 G at AA)***\n\nHarris was signed in 2022 as a minor league free gent coming out of college. He is a bit older, but he had a really nice year in 2023 working in relief. He is also left-handed which affords opportunities. I could see him beginning the year in AAA, and being someone who is on the watch list for major league innings if the Braves have bullpen issues.\n\n***Jhancarlos Lara - 21 - 15 S (20 GP), 81.1 IP, 4.09 ERA, 12.6 K/9, 4.6 BB/9, 3.48 xFIP (18 G at A)***\n\nLara is another young DR signing, beginning his pro career in 2021. Despite some walk issues, he had a very good year in 2023. I believe he will begin the year at A+, as he only pitched in 2 games there last year.\n\n***AJ Smith-Shawver - 21 - 15 S, 62.0 IP, 2.76 ERA, 11.5 K/9, 4.8 BB/9, 4.87 xFIP (10 G at AAA)***\n\nWe end the pitching list with one of the biggest movers of the year. AJ has excellent stuff, and is still extremely young. He is definitely part of the Braves 2024 plans, and hopefully is able to rein in his control/command going forward.\n\n**Catchers**\n\n***Javier Valdes - 25 - 298 PA, .234/.379/.402, 8 HR, 115 wRC+ (15% better than league average) 15.4% BB, 21.1% K - AA***\n\nValdes is a 2019 draftee (21st round), and has shown some nice offensive potential the last couple years. I especially like his walk and strikeout rates. He spent the whole year at AA and put up good numbers. I'm not sure how he he rates defensively, but he should be one of the main catchers at AAA in 2024. He is a bit older but not too old yet in terms of prospects.\n\n***Tyler Tolve - 23 - 217 PA, .238/.304.394, 7 HR, 84 wRC+, 9.2% BB, 27,2% K - AA***\n\nTolve was the other primary catcher at AA, and was a little bit below league average offensively. However, for catchers that is not always a huge concern, and I'm not sure how good his defense is to counteract his offensive skills. He is still very young and has plenty of time to continue to develop. I believe he will begin the year back in AA.\n\n***Drake Baldwin - 23 - 476 PA, .270/.385/.460, 16 HR, 135 wRC+ (A+), 14.1% BB, 20.6% K - A+/AA/AAA***\n\nBaldwin had a really great year, spending most of the year in A+ and ending with a 3 game cup of coffee in AAA. I think it's clear the Braves like him since they moved him up 2 levels later in the year. Offensively he was a monster, being 3rd in the South Atlantic League by wRC+. Defensively, again I'm not too sure how he is, but with a strong bat he could project at other positions like potentially corner outfield or 1st base.\n\n***Will King - 20 - 37 PA, .310/.405/.448, 1 HR, 123 wRC+, 16.2% BB, 16.2% K - CPX***\n\nKing is a young catcher who had a small sample size in the development league after being drafted in the 20th round in 2023. He did have good numbers, but again it's a very small sample. Someone to watch in 2024.\n\n**Infielders**\n\n***Vaughn Grissom - 23 - 468 PA, .330/.419/.501, 8 HR, 135 wRC+, 12.0% BB, 14.1% K - AAA***\n\nVaughn had an excellent offensive year in AAA, and showed why he is very highly considered by the Braves. He was tied for 3rd in the International League in wRC+. Defensively is another story, as we are all aware of the work needed there. He is still pretty young so there is plenty of time to keep working on his defense.\n\n***Luke Waddell - 25 - 577 PA, .275/.384/.376, 8 HR, 120 wRC+ (AA), 14.7% BB, 12.5% K - AA/AAA***\n\nLuke is a 5th round pick out of the 2021 draft, and had a solid year at AA before ending the year with some time in AAA. He has an excellent eye at the plate, and offers some defensive versatility as well. I don't think he projects as more than a utility player at this point, but he could be a solid bench piece for the Braves. He played several different positions.\n\n***Ignacio Alvarez - 21 - 501 PA, .284/.395/.391, 7 HR, 123 wRC+, 13.2% BB, 17.4% K - A+***\n\nAlvarez is the Braves 5th round pick in 2022, and he was very good last year in A+. He showed excellent plate discipline, and also stole 16 bases. Defensively I'm sure he is a work in progress, but he didn't bounce around too much so the Braves must believe at this point he can handle SS.\n\n***Keshawn Ogans - 22 - 454 PA, .265.360.397, 9 HR, 112 wRC+, 10.1% BB, 19.2% K - A+***\n\nOgans, our 19th round pick from 2022, also had a very solid year in A+. He played a mix of 2B/3B, and I think at this point he also projects as more of a utility player who does a little bit of everything. He is still young enough to maybe add some muscle or something and increase his stock.\n\n***John Gil - 18 - 199 PA, .285/.409/.386, 1 HR, 120 wRC+, 16.6% BB, 17.1% K, - DSL***\n\nGil got a couple hundred at bats in the short season DSL, and had a solid showing as a teenager. Guys at this level don't tend to show much power yet, and Gil showed some great patience, although that can also be taken with a grain of salt due to the level of competition. Someone to keep an eye on due to his extremely young age. He played primarily 3B, although he also spent time at SS and 1B.\n\n***Mario Baez - 17 - 206 PA, .311/.393/.422, 3 HR, 121 wRC+, 9.7% BB, 12.1% K - DSL***\n\nAnother short season player, Baez was even younger than Gil at 16 last year. He showed a lot of promise, as in addition to his strong batting line he also stole 24 bases in just 47 games. Another lottery ticket-type player to watch going forward. Baez primarily played SS.\n\n***Justin Janas - 23 - 491 PA, .283/.365/.376, 4 HR, 133 wRC+ (A), 7.7% BB, 16.1% K - A/A+***\n\nJanas had a very strong showing in his time at Augusta, although not with much power, before struggling upon his promotion to Rome. Overall he had a solid year, but a 1B with little power probably isn't going to make it too far. He is young enough where we could see improvement, but I think he is more of a depth type player.\n\n***David McCabe - 24 - 524 PA, .276/.386/.450, 17 HR, 128 wRC+ (A+), 15.3% BB, 21.6% K - A/A+***\n\nMcCabe had a really nice year, however he is also a corner infield prospect who is going to be in his age 24 season and hasn't reached AA yet. I believe he will start there next year, and can hopefully continue to slug his way up the ladder. He also showed a great eye at the plate.\n\n**Outfielders**\n\n***Cody Milligan - 25 - 308 PA, .280/.377/.414, 3 HR, 114 wRC+, 12.3% BB, 21.8% K - AA***\n\nMilligan had a decent year, stealing 23 bases along with his batting line. Unfortunately, there is not much more projection to him, so I think he ends up as a utility player in the future if he makes it to the majors. He can play all the outfield positions along with 2B.\n\n***Ethan Workinger - 22 - 459 PA, .258/.325/.415, 12 HR, 149 wRC+ (A), 8.7% BB, 24% K - A/A+***\n\nIt was a tale of two seasons for Workinger, who dominated A ball before really struggling at A+. Overall, he had an OK line, and he is still young enough to improve.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOverall, while the system lacks a definitive top end prospect or two, I think there is some great talent in the system overall, and some names to watch out for in 2024.

Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and Teoscar Hernandez are fine but nothing special. Cody Bellinger's contract will not age well.\n\nBut Braves really must acquire a corner OF; other than Acu\u00f1a, the only player on this roster who's played big-league innings in a corner is Forrest Wall. I think the Braves' statement about trying Vaughn Grissom in LF is a smokescreen - if you were really interested in Grissom as your opening day LF starter, why depend on winter league to get him reps in the outfield? Why hasn't he played a single inning of outfield in the minors? Even if that's their plan - but particularly if it isn't - the Braves need a veteran who can play some innings in a corner this year.\n\nSo I've looked at all 29 other major league rosters, with a goal of finding realistic trade targets. You're welcome.\n\n***My criteria for a trade target:***\n\n1. **Trading away the player has to make logical sense for the other team.** Jarred Kelenic, for example, is similarly valuable to other players I've included here. But the Mariners intend to compete in 2024, they don't intend to increase payroll meaningfully, and they're already losing Hernandez in FA, which means that trading Kelenic would leave them surrounding J-Rod with Dylan Moore and Cade Marlow in the outfield last year. Not gonna happen.\n2. **The player has to be capable of hitting the ball hard.** The Braves place a clear priority on hitting the ball hard. This is true both of their superstars and of their role players - Jake Lamb and Sam Hilliard were acquired under the \"let's see if we can build on this guy's ability to hit the ball hard\" philosophy, and Orlando Arcia has seen a spike in his hard-hit rate from his Milwaukee days. This means that while average-y power metrics are fine, real soft-contact guys like Dylan Carlson and Jake McCarthy won't make the cut.\n3. **The player has to be affordable without giving up a top prospect.** For the purpose of this exercise, I'm thinking of the top young arms (AJSS, Waldrep, Murphy, Ritchie) as untouchable. If there's an opportunity to acquire an established top-of-rotation starter, you've got to be willing to deal any of those guys. But left field just doesn't matter that much. We're looking for competence, with either greater stability or more upside than the Braves were going to get out of Eddie Rosario. We're not looking for greatness. I've checked BaseballTradeValues and I've set the ceiling for these guys at \\~$15M of surplus value - approximately what Vaughn Grissom is worth. You can get many of them for less (think Spencer Schwellenbach).\n\n***The targets:***\n\nI've ordered these players (roughly) based on how much I'd like to obtain them.\n\n**Max Kepler (MIN)** \\- age 31, 1 year of control ($10M salary in 2024)\n\n* *Why he's probably available*: Minnesota has announced that it's scaling back payroll this year, both because last year was a franchise high and because of uncertainty around the Twins' TV deal. Kepler ranks 4th on the team in AAV, behind Carlos Correa (immovable), Byron Buxton (also immovable), and Jorge Polanco (also being shopped). With a year till he hits free agency, the Twins would be well-served to move Kepler.\n* *Why he makes sense*: Kepler is coming off the best offensive year of his career (124 wRC+) and actually did so while underperforming his xwOBA. He plays good corner OF defense (4 OAA in RF last year) and has played CF in a pinch as recently as 2021. Skeptics will point to back-to-back seasons with a sub-100 wRC+ in 2021 and 2022. I'd point out that in both seasons, he suffered from some bad batted-ball luck, and that in both seasons, his defense was so good that he eclipsed the 2-WAR mark while playing an average of 118 games.\n\n**Tyler O'Neill (STL)** \\- age 29, 1 year of control ($5.4M arb estimate in 2024)\n\n* *Why he's probably available*: In 2021, O'Neill compiled 5.5 WAR in 138 games, putting up superlative offensive numbers and playing solid defense. He looked like a star. In the next two years, he hasn't even met the 100 wRC+ mark, his underlying metrics have taken a step back, and he's had public friction with his manager. And the Cardinals have plenty of other options in the outfield, particularly if they continue to treat Jordan Walker as an outfielder.\n* *Why he makes sense*: O'Neill's underlying numbers have taken a step back, but they're meaningfully better than his outputs; his Statcast page is still plenty red, just a lighter shade. O'Neill has walked at a 10% rate over the last two years and retains an excellent barrel rate. Injuries are a real concern with O'Neill, but the risk for a single inexpensive year is pretty low.\n\n**Anthony Santander (BAL)** \\- age 29, 1 year of control ($13.5M arb estimate in 2024)\n\n* *Why he's probably available*: Orioles ownership is already warning fans that the team can't afford to retain all of its young stars. Baltimore is entering its contention window, but seemingly without a commensurate payroll hike. Santander, projected to make between $13M and $14M next year, will be by far the highest-paid Oriole. He's a fine player, but with plenty of young hitters on the way up and not enough spots to play them, Baltimore would probably be glad to offload the salary.\n* *Why he makes sense*: As the most cash-expensive player on this list, Santander might come at the lowest prospect cost. He's coming off back-to-back 2.6 WAR seasons, and while his underlying offensive metrics took a major step back this year, his defense took a step forward. Bonus: he's a switch hitter.\n\n**Brent Rooker (OAK)** \\- age 29, 5 years of control ($750K salary in 2024)\n\n* *Why he's probably available*: After being outright waived by the Twins a year ago, Rooker ended up as an All-Star for Oakland - though pretty clearly an obligatory 'someone has to represent this team' pick. He's a feel-good story and maybe the team's best player right now, but he's also 29 years old and thus doesn't squarely fit their next contention window. He ended this season with 2.0 WAR in 137 games; he's a fine player, but not a star.\n* *Why he makes sense:* Rooker is cheap, controlled player who hits the ball hard (93rd percentile barrel rate, 91st percentile hard-hit rate), and his strikeout issues (4th percentile) might be a sacrifice the Braves are willing to make. He's not a particularly good defender, but neither was Rosario.\n\n**Alex Verdugo (BOS)** \\- age 27, one year of control ($9M arb estimate in 2024)\n\n* *Why he's probably available*: Like O'Neill, Verdugo has feuded with his manager. Acquired as the centerpiece of the Mookie Betts trade (another trade for a rental corner OF!), he's basically a 2-WAR outfielder. Put together the managerial tension and his rental status and even if the Red Sox aren't actively shopping Verdugo, there's no reason to think they're attached to him. That's especially true since the man who acquired him - Chaim Bloom - was shipped out from Boston this fall.\n* *Why he makes sense*: Verdugo is a left-handed outfielder with average exit velocity but a pretty great feel for contact (85th percentile chase rate, 94th percentile whiff rate, 85th percentile xBA). Maybe there's an approach shift in there to tune him towards more power. He's also a fine defender.\n\nHope this gives folks something to chat about while we wait for more signings!", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": 0.9988}, {"ranking": 0.8103448275862069, "comments": "Found some 90's nostalgia Thought this thread would appreciate these.", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": 0.4019}, {"ranking": 0.8103448275862069, "comments": "Details On The Dodgers\u2019 And Braves\u2019 Pursuits Of Aaron Nola If we have at least 6/162 for Nola (a #2), we should be able to give Yamamoto a competitive offer.

I am open to being corrected on any of the below; this is my understanding from reading a bunch of articles and spending too much time on Cot's Contracts. Also note that the numbers I discuss below vary slightly from site to site, but that Cot's is extremely well regarded.\n\n**TL;DR - the Braves have consistently raised payroll for most of a decade now. They don't have silly money, but they've likely got in the neighborhood of \\~$20M to spend and could go higher than that without meaningfully harming their luxury tax standing. Most importantly, there's nothing that suggests that they're scraping the ceiling right now and desperately need the $500K they saved in the Kyle Wright trade.**\n\n**The Past**\n\nThis time every year, I see something like, \"they always make these promises about financial flexibility and we NEVER do anything\". Now, it's certainly true the Braves haven't made a big splash in free agency in a long time. Marcell Ozuna's 4/$65M deal was the second-largest free agent contract in team history (this doesn't account for inflation but bleh, whatever). The team hasn't ever given out a deal that was 6 years or longer. \n\nBut the Braves under AA/McGuirk have promised that payroll would go up as the team got better and as fans filled the seats, and sure enough, it has. At the end of 2018, the Braves' tax payroll was $136M, 18th in the league and well under the lowest threshold. At the end of last year, it was $250M, well into the first layer of the tax and 8th in the league. **With the exception of some pandemic-era caution in 2021, the Braves' payroll has increased every year since 2016.** \n\nWon't bore you with any more here, but the point I'm making is that even if it's taken forms other than blockbuster free agency (extending young stars, trading for other teams' elite talent, high-AAV short-term signings), the Braves have upheld their promise to increase payroll. It's now a top-ten payroll and the team is a luxury tax payor, which a ton of people (including [beat writers](https://twitter.com/DOBrienATL/status/1590547681092722688)) would have told you was impossible just a year ago.\n\n**The Present**\n\n[Alex Anthopoulos](https://twitter.com/JustinCToscano/status/1722382493603795177) and [Terry McGuirk](https://twitter.com/AJCsports/status/1722369412760510505) have both announced that they expect payroll to go up this year. Of course, they haven't said by how much. We also know that they [use an internal budget](https://theathletic.com/4041606/2022/12/28/atlanta-braves-extensions/) that doesn't seem to be calculated the way the luxury tax payroll is (which aligns with recent actions like heavily backloading Reynaldo Lopez's contract). But let's guess how much money the Braves have to spend anyway. Two key numbers to keep in mind. **Last year, the Braves ended the season with a $211M payroll, or a $250M tax payroll.** (The discrepancy between the two is that the tax payroll is calculated by AAV, so while Spencer Strider was only paid $1M last year, his $12.5M AAV is what counts towards the tax.) **As it stands, the Braves' projected payroll for 2024 is $206M, or a $238M tax payroll.** This assumes that every open spot is filled by someone making the minimum, and it accounts for arbitration salaries. \n\n*The floor:* Let's assume the floor is that the Braves spend one dollar more than they spent last year. This means that to get to last year's numbers, the Braves would have another $5 million in 2024 salary to give out. They'd end up in the first level of the tax again (the minimum is $237M this year). In this scenario, the Braves don't sign another starting pitcher, and they go cheap in LF, re-reuniting with Adam Duvall or trying to fix Hunter Renfroe or maybe even just bringing back Eddie Rosario at a lower number.\n\n*The ceiling:* The biggest year-over-year payroll jump the Braves have made in the modern era came from 2021 to 2022, when the Braves added $40M in commitments. I just don't see a way the Braves jump from the first level of the tax to the third level of the tax. So I think the ceiling looks like the Braves entering the second level of the tax and spending towards the top of it (the third level of the tax is where you start getting draft picks moved back.) In this scenario, the Braves would have a little under $40M in 2024 salary to give out. That would mean the Braves would be financially competitive for any non-Ohtani pitcher on the market, and would still probably have remaining money to make a run at one of the better LF options like Hernandez or Gurriel.\n\n*My best guess:* Atlanta got really close to the second tier of the tax last year - they ended just $3M short of the threshold. It's not a big deal to cross into the second tier of the tax, since the heightened rate just applies to whatever overage there is. So let's say they hover right around the top of the first threshold again, ready to enter the second threshold for the right deal but happy to stay in the first if not. **In this scenario - which I think is the most likely - the Braves have roughly $20 million in 2024 salary to give out.** It wouldn't be a big deal for luxury tax purposes to go over this a bit - say, $25M AAV for the right pitcher. And it would represent another healthy increase in the team's payroll. But it's unlikely that they can *both* afford a high-end starter in the Gray/Montgomery mold and pay an 8-figure salary to a left fielder.\n\n**The Future** (everything here is my opinion alone, not based on anything the team has said about its plans)\n\nFor the first time in recent franchise history, the Braves should be thinking about the repeater taxes. The luxury tax rates increase with each successive year your team stays in the tax; by the third year, the lowest bracket goes from 20% to 50%, for example. Duck under the tax for one year, though, and it all resets. (This is what the Dodgers were trying to do this year, and if they had won their claim to have Trevor Bauer's salary fully nullified, it would have worked.) \n\nNext year, the Braves will likely see \\~$59M come off their tax payroll between Fried, Morton, Ozuna, Minter and the potential declines of Matzek and d'Arnaud's team options. I recognize that they could bring back any or all of these guys - but Fried seems really unlikely, Morton's 40, Ozuna probably isn't a good buy at his $16M team option, Matzek is cheap and a long-shot anyway and d'Arnaud is coming off a bad year. If the Braves let those guys go and replaced them inexpensively (fill one of Morton or Fried's rotation spots from within, get a backup catcher who costs less than $8 million, use the other highly paid relievers), they could get under the tax. Do that and they could be highly aggressive in adding new payroll in 2026 onwards - which might be about the right time to extend Albies and Acu\u00f1a again, grab another free agent starter, etc. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9997}, {"ranking": 0.8103448275862069, "comments": "1950s-1980s Braves autographs in my collection.

After AA decided to opt out of Eddie Rosario's contract, it is fair to assume that Vaughn Grissom could be the opening day starter in LF.\n\nHowever, Jason Heyward could be a great platoon option to Vaughn with his revamped swing &amp; stellar defense. The Dodgers lauded him for his leadership in the clubhouse while mentoring James Outman. He would be an awesome mentor to both Vaughn and Money Mike.\n\nThe main problem I see is that Heyward has only played 25 innings in his career in LF, so he would be looking at an entirely new position. Additionally, I don't think he has any lasting ties to folks in the Braves org (like he did with Freddie in LA), so he would be taking a hometown discount purely to be back in ATL. The Cubs are still paying him $22m next season after they opted out of his contract...maybe money isn't a huge factor. After all, he did accept a minor league contract last season with the Dodgers.\n\nAccording to Fabian Ardaya [in his Athletic article](https://theathletic.com/5022474/2023/11/02/dodgers-free-agent-jason-heyward/), he is expected to earn \"one year, $6.5 million with up to $8 million in incentives) but with a possibility of a multiyear deal.

I personally was too young to remember the 1987 AL East race between the Tigers and Jays, which your team won (ptuey). After that thrilling race, the Tigers went on to play the Minnesota Twins in the ALCS.\n\nNow, heading into this series, some people thought that Detroit would sweep Minnesota and leave them for dead. And who could blame them? The Tigers had an MLB-best 98-64 record and hit a league-leading 225 home runs during the regular season. They still had the core of the \u201884 WS winning team intact. Moreover, the Twins won the AL West with an 85-77 record and didn\u2019t have very well-known players at the time with the possible exception of Frank Viola and HOFers Kirby Puckett and Bert Blyleven.\n\nWhen the games were played though, Minnesota bested Detroit easily, 4-1, to win their first pennant since 1965, and Gary Gaetti won ALCS MVP. The Twins went on to beat the Cardinals in the WS in seven games.\n\nWhat, in your opinion, made the Tigers flame out so badly against a team that, theoretically, they should\u2019ve crushed? Do you think they could\u2019ve beaten the Twins had certain things gone their way, e.g., had Darrell Evans not gotten picked off third in Game 4?

He played in only 14 few games in September of 1972 and was not on the Tigers' ALCS roster against the A's.  Most of his career was spent with the Dodgers and Senators.

Howard was a good athlete, being an All-American at Ohio State in both basketball and baseball in the late 1950s.

By contrast, the right field roof was cleared 31 times by 21 different players, several of whom did it several times, and several others hit balls off of the lights or light towers, most famously Reggie Jackson in the 1971 All-Star game.\n\nSo it was a brief stay, but Howard closed out a very good career as a Detroit Tiger and deserves to be remembered for it.", "date": "20231104", "sentiment": 0.9851}, {"ranking": 0.3793103448275862, "comments": "Tigers officially declined the $30m contract option on Miguel Cabrera for 2024, a procedural move that clears the way for his retirement.

The Twins acquired him in the 2020 MLB draft (round 4, pick 128 overall). Raya\u2019s scouting grades:\n\nFastball | Curveball | Slider | Changeup | Control| Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n60 | 50 | 55 | 50 | 50 | 50\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | W | L | ERA | FIP | IP | H | ER | BB | K | WHIP\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nA+ | 0 | 1 | 2.94 | 3.63 | 33.2 | 23 | 11 | 8 | 39 | 0.921\nAA | 0 | 3 | 5.28 | 4.45 | 29.0 | 22 | 17 | 13 | 26 | 1.241\nTotal | 0 | 4 | 4.02 | x | 62.2 | 45 | 28 | 22 | 65 | 1.069\n\n# The recap\n\nRaya was drafted in 2020, but thanks to a pandemic that wiped out the 2020 minor league season, then a shoulder injury that kept him sidelined for all of 2021, Raya\u2019s professional debut didn\u2019t come until 2022. But it was an impressive showing from the then-19 year old in Fort Myers, as he pitched to a 3.05 ERA over 65 innings, along with 76 strikeouts. After a rough welcome to pro ball where he got knocked around for 7 hits and 3 runs (2 earned) in 4.1 innings in his debut, outing #2 was an absolute gem \u2013 he shut down the Dunedin Blue Jays for 6 innings, allowing just 1 hit and 0 runs while striking out 10 and walking none, earning him recognition as FSL Pitcher of the Week. That would be by far his best outing of his season, but the rest of the year was pretty solid, ending with a 1.077 WHIP and a 10.5 K/9 in his first taste of action.\n\nThat set the stage for 2023, where Raya moved up a level to start the year in Cedar Rapids. After an iffy start to his season allowing 5 runs over 5.2 innings in his first 2 starts combined, Raya then went on a dominant run \u2013 over his next 4 starts, he allowed just 4 hits and no runs across 12 full innings, striking out 14 and walking just 1 over that span. The hits crept up a bit over the following 3 starts, with 7 hits in 10 innings, but he continued to pitch effectively, striking out 13 and allowing only 3 runs during that stretch. While his next two starts would take a step back (combined 6 runs (3 earned) in 6 innings with 8 hits and 6 strikeouts to 3 walks), his great run prior to that helped earn him a promotion to AA at the start of July.\n\nIf you look at Raya\u2019s line from his first stint at AA, you might be disappointed with how it looks \u2013 a 5+ ERA and 14 walks in 29 innings is definitely not what you\u2019d hope to see. However, you really need to drill into Raya\u2019s game logs to get the full picture. Raya actually pitched very competently at AA, outside of 2 back to back starts at the end of July/start of August where he gave up 8 runs in 2.1 innings, then in his next start, gave up 6 runs (4 earned) while unable to record a single out. But if we were to exclude those 2 starts and look at the rest of his body of work (a dangerous act, but take it for what it is) \u2013 suddenly Raya\u2019s AA ERA is all the way down to just 1.71! That\u2019s right, excluding those 2 really rough outings, Raya gave up only 5 earned runs in his remaining 26.2 innings with the Wind Surge. Now, it\u2019s not all the perfect showing even if we entirely throw out his 2 bad starts \u2013 Raya walked 12 batters in those 26.2 innings, and his K/9 dipped under the magic 9.0 benchmark for the first time in his career. But still, for a 20 year old facing his first AA competition, who were on average 4.5 years older than him, I\u2019m really encouraged by what we saw from Raya. He ended the season on a high note as well, allowing just 5 hits over his last 11 shutout innings (3 starts) with 9 strikeouts and 1 walk, earning him recognition as Twins minor league pitcher of the month for September. And let\u2019s take a step back and look big picture  \u2013 Raya\u2019s still only 21 years old, just reached AA in his second season in action, and did so after missing all of 2021 with a shoulder injury. Raya\u2019s come a long way in a very short time, and outside of a few starts, has gotten some great results in his young career. 2023 was an exciting season for Raya and puts him in a wonderful position to build off of heading into 2024.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nTo set the stage here, I\u2019m really excited about Raya. I think he\u2019s working with a great starting point, plenty of room to grow further, and all the time in the world to put it all together. It\u2019s not hard to envision a future down the road with Raya being a quality middle of the rotation starter in the majors, with some room on either side. There\u2019s a couple of things I think we can key in on to help him get there, but to touch on his timeline first \u2013 entering the 2024 season as just a 21 year old, Raya will get all of the time he needs at AA. I have to imagine he\u2019s looking at the large majority of the season at minimum at AA again, but beyond that just comes down to how he continues to develop. A 2025 debut seems slightly possible if 2024 goes well, but 2026 is more likely. The big point here though, is hell, he could not debut until 2027 and still only be 24 years old at call-up. At this point I\u2019m not inclined to predict it\u2019ll take that long, but Raya has absolutely zoomed along the development path even with missing 2 minor league seasons, so there is no rush to get him up to the majors sooner than later. Not to say there\u2019s reason to hold him down either, just that we\u2019re truly at a point where we can give him as much time as it takes and not have anything to worry about on that front.\n\nNow, there\u2019s a few things we\u2019ll hope to see in 2024. The first I\u2019ll just touch on briefly as I\u2019m relying on scouting reports here, but let\u2019s talk about Raya\u2019s repertoire. His fastball is clearly his best pitch, but reports also like both his curveball and slider, and give the impression that he can be successful even with just those 3 which project to be at least above average. But Raya has also worked on a changeup that is noticeably behind the rest of his pitches. If he\u2019s able to turn the changeup into a useable weapon, though, that gives him a true 4-pitch mix to work with, raising his ceiling even higher.\n\nThe next step, and I\u2019d assume next logical progression the Twins have for him, is to get stretched out further. Raya has put together back to back full, healthy seasons, making 19 and 22 starts respectively. But he\u2019s also topped out at only 65 innings pitched in a season, largely thanks to him never \u2013 yes, never \u2013 throwing more than 4 innings in a game thus far in his career. And that\u2019s likely by design, no need whatsoever to overwork someone who\u2019s so young. Goes back to my point about the timeline, the Twins will take as long as they need with Raya, there\u2019s just no need to rush. And this might be the thing that ultimately slows him down the most. But I would like to see him start to go a little longer into games just to prove he can do it, and start building up a fuller season. The 100-120 inning benchmark would be a good target for next year and give him a good springboard into 2025.\n\nLastly, we have to touch on Raya\u2019s walks. He\u2019s put up back to back seasons walking 3.2 batters per 9 innings, which would place him just outside the top 10 highest rates in the majors from this past season. As we\u2019ve said before, that\u2019s not instantly a death sentence, as guys like Blake Snell, Kodai Senga, and Corbin Burnes were all around or above that 3.2 mark this year. But obviously you want to limit baserunners in all forms as much as you can, and I think this is the lowest hanging fruit for Raya to start cleaning up as he continues to refine his control. It is possible that 3.2 mark is inflated, too \u2013 reports are he\u2019s worked on his changeup grip throughout the season, and just getting used to that in a game setting is more important than having perfect control at this point. Raya\u2019s so far ahead on his timeline that it\u2019s honestly not critical to start improving this yet, as the process is still more important than the results at this point. But in a perfect world, that\u2019s one more important spot we\u2019ll hope to see some improvement on in 2024.\n\n# Highlights/film room\n\n* [October 2022 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNAgtCwDGdQ&amp;ab_channel=JohnVittas)\n* [Tom Froemming recap of AA debut](https://youtu.be/6_HDK_CM2mc?si=GWF1j2CQBkw7-yc4&amp;t=151)\n* [4 strikeouts in 4 innings in 3rd start at AA](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1682741658989875202)\n* [4 one-hit innings in final start of the year](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1703083892486320419)\n\n-----------------------\n\n# Alejandro Hidalgo\n\n-----------------------\n\n# A refresher\n\nHidalgo is a 20-year old RHP from Venezuela. The Twins acquired him in trade for Gio Urshela in November 2022. Prior to that, Hidalgo was in the Angels organization after being signed as an international free agent in summer 2019. Hidalgo\u2019s scouting grades:\n\nFastball | Slider | Changeup | Control| Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n50 | 50 | 55 | 40 | 40\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | W | L | ERA | FIP | IP | H | ER | BB | K | WHIP\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nA+ | 0 | 5 | 5.28 | 5.95 | 58.0 | 52 | 34 | 53 | 57 | 1.810\nTotal | 0 | 5 | 5.28 | 5.95 | 58.0 | 52 | 34 | 53 | 57 | 1.810\n\n# The recap\n\nBefore joining the Twins about a year ago, Hidalgo spent the last 2 seasons with the Angels, where he sort of had done just enough to be interesting in some respects, but enough question marks to not get too excited about him, either. Across a combined 66 innings in rookie and A ball with the Angels, Hidalgo threw a 4.63 ERA with 89 strikeouts and 28 walks \u2013 truthfully, that serves as a great one sentence summary of the bulk of what we\u2019ll talk about on him. He was able to rack up the strikeouts at an elite 12.1 K/9 rate while pitching to players on average 3 years older than him, making him on one hand super intriguing. But on the other hand, he struggled a lot with giving batters free bases, at a 3.8 BB/9 rate. For a little context, that K/9 rate would have been 2nd highest in the majors this year, but the BB/9 rate would have been 6th highest.\n\nThe Twins elected to start Hidalgo off at A+ in Cedar Rapids, where he began working a starter, as he had over the past 2 years. Unfortunately, his season debut would prove to be fairly emblematic of how his season as a whole would look \u2013 while lasting only 1.2 innings, Hidalgo allowed only 1 run and struck out 3, but also walked a whopping 6 batters. Hidalgo faired much better in his follow-up outing, throwing 4 innings of relief while allowing 2 unearned runs and 4 strikeouts and 0 walks, but the walk problem came back right after that, as he allowed 3+ walks in 3 of his next 4 starts. Hidalgo\u2019s best outing of the year game in early May when he threw 5.1 scoreless innings, allowing just 3 hits and a single walk along with 9 strikeouts, but then following his next 3 starts walking a combined 11 batters in 9.1 innings, the Twins shifted him to a multi-inning reliever until late in the season.\n\nI wish I could say that change helped prompt some better results, but it simply did not. Over his next 12 games, Hidalgo game up 24 earned runs in 29.2 innings, good for a 7.28 ERA. The walk problem also did not resolve itself, as he put 26 batters on from bases on balls. The one real saving grace we have here is that Hidalgo racked up 32 strikeouts during that stretch, but that 9.8 K/9 rate was still way down from the 12.1 rate he posted over the prior 2 seasons. Hidalgo left the bullpen and got 2 more games as the starter to close out the season, but still similar results to show for it, with 5 earned runs in 5 innings along with 8 hits, 6 walks, and only 1 strikeout. Although Hidalgo was not expected to be a top org arm by any means, it was nevertheless a disappointing season for him in his first year in the Twins system.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nLet\u2019s not mess around here, Hidalgo absolutely needs to cut down on the walks if he is to have any shot of going anywhere in our system. His 3.1 BB/9 prior to joining our organization was already going to be an area that needed to be addressed \u2013 and then he went out and posted a nutty 8.2 BB/9. On the plus side, Hidalgo is still only 20 years old and still young for A+. That, combined with reports that he\u2019s been working on adjusting his delivery and modifying his pitch mix, could help minimize the concern about his walks. Same as we talked about with Raya above, the process is more important than the results so early on, and if Hidalgo\u2019s actively tinkering with multiple core components of his pitching, then we can understand if the results aren\u2019t quite there yet. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to say that can\u2019t account for all of it here \u2013 over 8 walks per 9 innings is just too obscenely high, and does not bode well, regardless of what is being worked on behind the scenes.\n\nAside from that obvious component, the main thing I\u2019ll be looking for reports on about Hidalgo next year is simply how his stuff looks. His prospect reports are scattered comments that just aren\u2019t all that interesting, from \u201c[stuff that] doesn\u2019t necessarily jump off the page\u201d, to a frame that\u2019s \u201cwell composed but not especially projectable\u201d, to \u201ca bevy of solid components, but not the sort of premium athleticism or projection that portend potential impact growth\u201d. There aren\u2019t necessarily a lot of lines that are overly pessimistic, but there\u2019s also not much that leaves glowing reviews about any component of his game. With a fastball that sits 92-94, adding a few ticks would go a long way. And beyond that, it sounds like the Twins have been working on adjusting most of his other pitches, so we\u2019ll just have to wait for more scouting reports into next season and see if they\u2019re starting to give us any more reason for optimism. Hidalgo didn\u2019t look bad through his first handful of starts this year, in fact with a 1.50 ERA and 19 strikeouts over his first 5 starts and 18 innings, you can even say he looked pretty exciting. But his season as a whole is just too much to look past at this point and pretend that we get very invested at this point.\n\nHidalgo was originally traded straight up for 1 year of a fairly expensive Gio Urshela, so hopes were never all that high that Hidalgo would instantly become a top organizational prospect, or rise to those ranks anytime in the future. And I still don\u2019t think there\u2019s reason to criticize the trade by any means. But overall I find myself pretty uninvested in Hidalgo and without much optimism for him moving up the prospect rankings anytime soon \u2013 in fact, I\u2019m a little surprised he\u2019s even inside our top 30. Hidalgo only managed to rank as the 15th best prospect in a terrible Angels system, and perhaps it\u2019s worth noting that he ranked somewhere outside the top 36 in Fangraph\u2019s midseason organizational rankings this year. At any rate, Hidalgo\u2019s youth and strikeout upside give enough reason to keep an eye on him, but he has a long way to go before much excitement should grow.\n\n# Highlights/film room\n\n* [9 Ks in 5.1 innings in season\u2019s-best performance](https://twitter.com/MLBPipeline/status/1653820144475316231)\n* [Tom Froemming early season recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itAaAmHypMc&amp;ab_channel=TFTwins)", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.9998}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "[Feinsand] The Reds have agreed to a two-year deal with RHP Emilio Pag\u00e1n, per source.

The Twins acquired him in 2019 by signing him as an international free agent for $2.5 million. Rodriguez\u2019s scouting grades:\n\nHit | Power | Run | Arm | Field | Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n50 | 60 | 55 | 60 | 60 | 55\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | G | AB | H | 2B | HR | RBI | SB | K | BB | AVG | OBP | SLG | wRC+\n:-- | :-- |  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nA+ | 99 | 354 | 85 | 13 | 16 | 55 | 20 | 134 | 92 | .240 | .400 | .463 | 145\nTotal | 99 | 354 | 85 | 13 | 16 | 55 | 20 | 134 | 92 | .240 | .400 | .463 | 145\n\n# The recap\n\nI think it\u2019s worth starting Rodriguez\u2019s recap way back in 2021 at the start of his minor league career. His first taste of action was in rookie ball, where he got 37 games in, slashing .214/.346/.524 with 5 doubles and 10 home runs, and 56 strikeouts to 23 walks in just over 150 plate appearances. It\u2019s not an awful showing for an 18 year old\u2019s first taste of action, but also nothing that would have anyone overly excited. But then we flash forward to 2022, where E-Rod put together one of the biggest prospect breakout stretches in all of baseball. In A ball for Fort Myers, Rodriguez was absolutely electric. He hit .272/.493/.552 with 5 doubles and 9 homers, 52 strikeouts and **57 walks** in 199 PAs. That\u2019s good for a *196* wRC+. Rodriguez\u2019s season was unfortunately cut short in June after a meniscus injury, but his ridiculous 47 game run put him on the map across the league. Excitement was sky high and prospect evaluators across the board had him pegged for another meteoric rise in 2023 if he kept the momentum rolling.\n\nEnter 2023, now playing as a 20 year old in High-A for Cedar Rapids. Rodriguez had a boom and bust start to the season over his first 7 games. The boom: He hit 3 homers along with a double and a triple. The bust: He struck out 17 times and had just 2 other hits, good for a .185 average. After that week of play, Rodriguez came down with the injury bug again, with an abdomen strain. This time, though, he would only be sidelines for a hair over 2 weeks, and he was back in action at the start of May. It took him some time to get going, however, as his slash line in May was even worse than his 7 game start in April, at .155/.318/.254 and just one double and a pair of homers in 20 games. After that, though, E-Rod was back. He kicked off June with a 3-hit game, and that was all he needed to get the ball rolling. He went on to slash .277/.425/.518 with 3 doubles and 5 homers across 100 PAs that month, and this time he\u2019d be able to carry that momentum through the rest of the year. From July 1st through the end of the year, he slashed .254/.418/.503 in 250 PAs, tallying 8 doubles, 7 triples, and 9 home runs, along with 73 strikeouts and 53 walks.\n\nWhile his end of season stat line didn\u2019t have the same level of eye popping ridiculousness that his breakout 2022 did, it was nevertheless a good year from the young Twins outfielder. He was named a Midwest League All-Star at the end of the season, and continued to see his prospect stock soar \u2013 MLB Pipeline had him ranked as the 88th best prospect in baseball entering the year, and jumped him all the way up to 48th at the end of the season.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nWhen thinking about what we want to see from E-Rod in 2024, I think the conversation has to start around continued health. It\u2019s a boring and low effort topic, but it\u2019s happened far too often that a super young guy with a lot of hype pans out to be injured more often than not and never goes anywhere. 2023 was a great start, Rodriguez had pretty much a full season of action with only that one minor injury. Worst case scenario would have been another knee injury that forces us to think about his knees long term. But it looks like they held up just fine this year, so with that out of the way, we can just mention health as a caveat and move on to more interesting topics.\n\nTouching first on his timeline, Rodriguez appears to be ready for a stop in AA at some point next year. I wouldn\u2019t be *shocked* if the Twins elect to have him start out in High-A again once more just to get the ball rolling before the big jump to AA. We have to temper expectations with Rodriguez\u2019s age \u2013 in his age 21 season next year, he\u2019ll be about 5 years younger than the average player at AA. So while the numbers themselves could probably justify a promotion already, it\u2019s possible the Twins want to take it a little slower and make sure they don\u2019t move him too quickly. I think the ideal case scenario is for Rodriguez to start in A+ again next year, but his play to quickly dictate a promotion by at least midseason, and from there give him plenty of time to adjust to the AA environment. It\u2019s hard to project timelines past then as it would really be dictated by his play, but I think the earliest I could possibly see him reaching the majors unless he just runs through all levels of play next year would be near the end of the 2025 season. Rodriguez is so young that we have so much time with him and no reason to move him quicker than he needs to be moved. We certainly want to challenge him and allow him to dictate the pace to an extent, but this isn\u2019t a case where there\u2019s much reason to be super aggressive unless he\u2019s simply too good and gives us no other choice.\n\nGetting to more about his play - If you\u2019ve read past episodes in this series, you\u2019re probably bored of me talking about K:BB, but it matters a lot for prospects, and E-Rod here is not only no different, but he has an absolutely fascinating K:BB history being built up. One of the biggest detractors against Rodriguez has always been a very high K rate \u2013 he struck out 36% of the time in rookie ball, 26% of the time in A ball, then 29% of the time this year at A+. Those are high numbers at any level, but especially for a guy so early on in their prospect journey. But the fascinating thing that\u2019s also happened these last 2 seasons is pairing a the strikeouts with ridiculous walk rate. In 2022 he walked over *28%* of the time, and this year walked a hair over 20% of the time. For a reminder of context, this year in the MLB nobody had a higher BB rate than Juan Soto \u2013 with a 18.6% rate. The fact that Rodriguez has managed to draw 149 walks in 146 games over the past 2 seasons is completely absurd. See what I mean when I say it\u2019s absolutely fascinating? That\u2019s HALF of Rodriguez\u2019s plate appearances that are ending in either a walk or a strikeout. Next year we just want to there to be not too big of a divergence between the two rates, especially when he reaches AA. The jump to AA is said to be the hardest switch in the minors, and it\u2019d be a red flag if the K rate jumps even higher while the walk rate takes a step back. But if he maintains both of them just where they\u2019ve been at, then we can start to feel more comfortable about that just being the type of player Rodriguez is, even if it is pretty unique.\n\nWith all of that said, someone who strikes out or walks half the time isn\u2019t all that interesting if they\u2019re not doing damage with the other half of their time at the plate. And even the type of damage matters too, if the rest of the output is home run or bust, we end up with a 3 true outcome guy a la prime Joey Gallo. If the remaining output is slapping a bunch of singles around, well that would be a really unique type of player, but of seemingly limited use. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been pleased at what we\u2019ve seen overall these last 2 seasons out of Rodriguez, and I\u2019m very interested to see what he produces outside of Ks and BBs next year and in AA. I would have loved for him to have hit for a better average this season, but if he ends up somewhere between his 2023 .240 and his 2022 .270 long term, I think that\u2019s just fine. We are still dealing with a pretty small sample size, but I still feel good about him racking up the extra base hits. It\u2019s been fun to see a good distribution of those (18 doubles, 12 triples, 25 homers) over the last 2 years. E-Rod hits the ball HARD and has great bat speed, so I\u2019m not worried about the power numbers following as long as he\u2019s able to keep making contact. He has been pull heavy, with a 43% pull rate in 2022 and a 51% pull rate this year (MLB average is around 37%), so that\u2019s one more thing to monitor as he continues facing better pitchers as well and hope either of those things don\u2019t turn into a limiting factor.\n\nAt the end of the day, we still have every reason to be excited about Rodriguez and the type of player he could eventually turn out to be. At this point the biggest thing is for him to just continue getting more time in the minors and keep proving himself at each level. As we stand now, we\u2019re still looking at a guy with less than 200 games in his professional league career, so by nature there\u2019s still a huge variance in where Rodriguez could ultimately end up. But it\u2019s hard not to be enthralled thinking about that upside and what it could look like in the majors down the road.\n\n# Highlights/film room\n\n* [Walkoff 3 run home run in spring training](https://twitter.com/Twins/status/1639353777365872640)\n* [Walkoff grand slam in April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNIHuCtlM_c&amp;ab_channel=BaseballIsEverything)\n* [Hits 3rd homer in 2 days in August](https://twitter.com/TwinsCentral1/status/1687275109264822272)\n* [Grand slam in winner take all game 3 of the Midwest League Championship](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1704870908165239179)\n\n-----------------------\n\n# Yunior Severino\n\n-----------------------\n\n# A refresher\n\nSeverino is a 24-year old switch hitting infielder from the Dominican Republic. The Twins signed him as an international free agent in 2017 for $2.5 million. Severino was originally signed by the Braves in 2016, but his contact was voided by the MLB as part of punishments handed down to the Braves following an investigation which showed the Braves [broke rules related to signing bonuses](https://www.foxsports.com/stories/other/braves-lose-13-prospects-gm-banned-for-life-in-international-signing-scandal) for international free agents. Severino\u2019s scouting grades:\n\nHit | Power | Run | Arm | Field | Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n45 | 50 | 45 | 55 | 40 | 40\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | G | AB | H | 2B | HR | RBI | SB | K | BB | AVG | OBP | SLG | wRC+\n:-- | :-- |  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nAA | 84 | 334 | 96 | 15 | 24 | 62 | 3 | 117 | 36 | .287 | .365 | .560 | 139\nAAA |364 | 133 | 24 | 2 | 11 | 22 | 0 | 56 | 15 | .233 | .320 | .511 | 100\nTotal | 120 | 467 | 127 | 17 | 35 | 84 | 3 | 173 | 51 | .272 | .352 | .546 | \n\n# The recap\n\nAfter joining the Twins system for the 2018 season for 50 games in rookie ball, a 2019 season all but lost to injury, and the 2020 minor league season that never was, Severino got his first real chance to make a name for himself in the 2021 season. He performed solidly, slashing .273/.372/.430 over 100 combined games at A and A+. But it was a 2022 breakout that really put him on the map, as he hit 17 doubles and 19 combined home runs across A+ and AA in 83 games while hitting .278. That power breakout set the tone and our hopes for the 2023 year as he started out back in AA for the Wind Surge.\n\nIn Wichita, Severino keep the hype surrounding him absolutely buzzing, slashing .291/.367/.557 with 7 doubles and 11 home runs in his first 40 games. June saw a little bit of a slide as he hit only .244 with 3 home runs that month, but July he got all the way back and then some, posting a stat line I had to double check was accurate, at .342/.432/.750 with 4 doubles and 9 homers in 20 games. That was plenty for him to earn a promotion to AAA at the start of August along with teammate Brooks Lee. In total, Severino slashed .287/.365/.560 across 84 games at AA, along with 15 doubles and a whopping 24 home runs.\n\nAlso mirroring Lee, Severino\u2019s first taste of AAA didn\u2019t go quite as well as his season to date had \u2013 but that\u2019s not to say it was at all dreadful, either. In August over his first 19 games with the Saints, Severino\u2019s average and OBP took a big step back at .235 and .299 respectively, but he still hit 5 homers along with a double and a triple to keep a strong slugging percentage of .500. The highlight of the month came with a 3-4 game on 8/20 where Severino mashed 2 homers and both scored and drove in 3 in a 7-6 Saints win. In September, it was nice to see some slight improvements, with Severino putting together a .231/.342/.523 line with 6 homers in 17 games to close out the year. Following the season, multiple prospect ranking organizations shelled out some accolades to Severino, including MLB Pipeline naming him Twins hitting prospect of the year, and Baseball America honoring him as Twins minor league player of the year.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nThis was clearly another very successful season for Severino, as we are seeing the product of his multi-year development hold strong. He\u2019s starting to get pretty close to the majors and could be in line for a debut in the second half of 2024. Or perhaps a prime trade candidate as a slugging infielder who is still a ways back on our depth chart. He might not be MLB ready quite yet, but he\u2019s getting pretty close, and the Twins are going to have to make a decision on how he fits in soon. But for our purposes here, let\u2019s ignore roster availability for now and stick to just looking at his development and what we would hope to see if back with the Twins for a full 2024 and beyond.\n\nAt this point it\u2019s clear that Severino\u2019s path to the majors will come from his power. In 2021 he slapped a bunch (29) of doubles in 98 games, but only came up with 8 homers. But in 2022 some of those doubles started dropping over the fence, and his line jumped to 17 doubles and 19 homers in 83 games. And 2023 was another positive step forward in the power department, with 17 doubles and a massive 35 dingers in just 120 games (which was tied for the most in all of the minors). So, seeing continued development on that front year over year and level over level, culminating in still posting a .500+ SLG in his first AAA exposure this year and hitting for as much power as anyone in the minors, is needless to say a great sign.\n\nHis power does come with the usual swing and miss tradeoffs \u2013 Severino\u2019s K rate has increased at each level for the past 2 seasons, first sitting at 23% at A+ in 2022, then jumping to 30% at AA that year. In AA in 2023 it crept up to 31%, and then in his AAA stint raised even higher up to a sky high 37%. Severino has pretty much always looked and felt like a 30% strikeout rate guy, so this isn\u2019t some unexpected or damning thing. But Severino will definitely need to bring that 36% rate in AAA back down a ways to help assuage concerns about how much he may be punched out in the majors. As a quick add-on, Severino\u2019s walk rate was 9.6% this year which is pretty solid, so the K rate does seem to be a more of a product of his high power approach, rather than a larger problem with his eye.\n\nHonestly, we could probably stop this section here and have pretty much covered it all with Severino. He\u2019s a definite power first type guy and needs that to continue on to be a viable MLB option. We could touch base on his defensive home, as his defense is poor (although he has a great arm), but Severino probably isn\u2019t in the Twins MLB defensive infield plans this year anyways with how many names are ahead of him on the depth chart, and for a guy like him it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world if he ends up as a DH as long as he does keep hitting. I do want to touch on the fact that Severino is a switch hitter and it\u2019s awesome to see a pretty even R/L split return this year (.268/.349/.552 as a lefty vs .289/.366/.522 as a righty) after he struggled to put up even splits in 2022 (.296/.391/.516 as a lefty but just .228/.311/.595 as a righty). I\u2019m also very encouraged that he\u2019s consistently put up a .500+ SLG against as both a lefty and righty for 2 full seasons in a row now. There are not many switching hitting power bats in the majors (only 5 switch hitters hit 25+ homers this season), and of those not a single one managed to post .500+ SLG from both sides of the plate. So strong power from both sides is a huge asset that should be called out in support of Severino.\n\nWhen we put it all together, there\u2019s a few questions that we\u2019ll hope to get a clearer picture of in 2024, some in Severino\u2019s control, and some out of his control. First, a major factor is going to be how high his strikeout rate gets. The 30% range is doable so long as the power sticks, but if it hangs around anywhere near the 36% we saw in his first AAA action this year, that\u2019s a little tougher. Truthfully, that along with how well Severino is able to continue hitting for power from both sides of the plate are really my 2 main areas of interest. I\u2019ll of course hope he can hit hitting in the .270 range as that makes him way more interesting than if he dives to the .230-.240 range, but I\u2019m not worried about his .233 mark in 36 AAA games yet so that\u2019s not even a factor for me at this point. And defensively, honestly I don\u2019t care too much either. It\u2019s clear he\u2019s a bat first guy and probably isn\u2019t going to be a net positive at any defensive position, so it\u2019s all about how high of a caliber that bat can be. Even if he comes a DH only guy, I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s also a .270, 25 double, 40 homer guy. While the nature of Severino\u2019s type of prospect makes him inherently risky (the power has to play in order to have value), it\u2019s also the type that has a super high upside, and the 2023 season showed us just what that can look like. There are still some concerns, but man does it look pretty when Severino connects and is launching balls all over. Severino has successfully answered more and more of the questions around him each of the past 3 seasons now, and we\u2019re starting to get close to the only remaining question being if he can do it in the majors or not.\n\nAs for the thing Severino can\u2019t control, that\u2019s simply what happens to him and the other infielders in the system around him. It\u2019s looking pretty clear that we\u2019ll want to trade some infielders this offseason, so who on the depth chart is moved, and how much does that open up a path to the majors for Severino simply based on numbers? Is Severino himself traded? That\u2019s an interesting topic that I\u2019ll save the bulk of the debate for in the comments, but while I am pretty intrigued about Severino, he also seems like a guy that could have some strong interest. It\u2019s something worth exploring, if nothing more. If he\u2019s not traded, it still gets hard to see space for him in the majors this year (without a bunch of injuries) just due to numbers. He\u2019s certainly not a guy the Twins are in a rush to get into the major league defensive infield, so it\u2019ll be his bat that has to force the issue. And while unleashing him as DH is intriguing, we are all thinking about the very real chance that Buxton needs the DH slot again. And even if not, we know the Twins like to keep DH open to cycle players through on rest days with. So while even if Severino does everything right and has another monster season in AAA next year, the Twins are still likely looking at a roster problem of how to get him up into the majors. This is always the type of thing that seems to work itself out with trades, signings, and injuries, but that\u2019s where we stand today.\n\n# Highlights/film room\n\n* [HRs in back to back at bats in April](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1PE_LfxhLY&amp;ab_channel=TheHubforBaseballHighlights)\n* [News story on Severino from Kansas news outlet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9DGyo1MrD4&amp;ab_channel=KSNTV)\n* [September nuke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6z1ntXtEvI&amp;ab_channel=BaseballIsEverything2)\n* [Severino and Brooks Lee both homer for the Saints](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1701256894252273928)\n* [400 foot blast marks a 3 game streak with a homer](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1702338864986091825)\n* [Tom Froemming\u2019s Severino home run compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Je06E1--Sw&amp;ab_channel=TFTwins)", "date": "20231124", "sentiment": 0.9999}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Filthiest Pitch Pole [Friedman] [PitchingNinja] It's a nice little opportunity to show Johan Duran some extra love.", "date": "20231124", "sentiment": 0.8593}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Pick Your Table (via Twins social media) ", "date": "20231123", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Hey 'Turkeys'....

Both proximity to the majors as well as prospect pedigree may impact this \u2013 those that may play a role on the Twins next year will naturally warrant more discussion than a back of the list guy with limited tape available where there will have to be a little more speculation. But I hope you enjoy and that this helps us all learn some new things and get to know our farm better!\n\nYou can catch up on prior episodes here:\n\n* [Episode 1 \u2013 Walker Jenkins (#1) and Andrew Morris (#30)](https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotatwins/comments/17z7svo/2023_twins_top_prospect_recaps_episode_1_walker)\n\nIn episode two, we\u2019ll look at the Twins #2 overall prospect, Brooks Lee, and #29 overall Noah Cardenas.\n\n-----------------------\n\n# Brooks Lee\n\n-----------------------\n\n# A refresher\n\nLee is a 22-year old switch hitting shortstop out of Cal Poly University. The Twins acquired him in the 2022 draft (round 1, pick 8 overall). Lee\u2019s scouting grades:\n\nHit | Power | Run | Arm | Field | Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n65 | 55 | 50 | 55 | 50 | 55\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | G | AB | H | 2B | HR | RBI | SB | K | BB | AVG | OBP | SLG | wRC+\n:-- | :-- |  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nAA | 87 | 349 | 102 | 31 | 11 | 61 | 6 | 63 | 41 | .292 | .365 | .476 | 120\nAAA | 38 | 152 | 36 | 8 | 5 | 23 | 1 | 28 | 15 | .237 | .304 | .428 | 78\nTotal | 125 | 501 | 138 | 39 | 16 | 84 | 7 | 91 | 56 | .275 | .347 | .461 |\n\n# The recap\n\nLee had a lot of eyes on him entering his first full season of professional baseball, as any former top 10 pick would. He performed very well in his first taste of professional life last year, even with the Twins aggressively pushing him to AA by season\u2019s end. Lee wasted no time getting right down to business, rattling off a 10 game hit streak to start the year in Wichita. He performed quite consistently in his 87 games with AA, and honestly it\u2019s hard to find much to complain or be worried about. If we want to get picky, he had a pretty brutal 2 week slump in May where he went 5 for 50 \u2013 but even then, during that span he still walked 7 times to 8 strikeouts, and he finished the last week of May hitting .393 with 4 doubles and a homer, helping keep his total May slash line at a solid .261/.352/.424. Lee kept the ball rolling in June, too, never going more than 2 games in a row without a hit. Then in July, Lee went a bonkers, hitting .365/.433/.600 in 20 games with 5 doubles, 5 homers, and 10 strikeouts to 10 walks. After just 2 more games in August, the Twins called him up to AAA.\n\nSt. Paul proved to be a little bit tougher of a go for Lee. While he would only have 4 hitless games in August, he also only had 4 multi-hit games, hitting .241 over the 21 game span with 18 strikeouts to 8 walks. He did still hit 5 doubles along with a triple and a homer, but we didn\u2019t get the hot start at a new level that we\u2019ve gotten so accustomed to seeing from Lee. September on the surface may look like only a slight improvement if anything, as Lee\u2019s average for the month (.231) took a step back and OBP (.306) improved only 8 points, but I\u2019m encouraged to see even  power numbers (3 doubles, 2 triples, and 4 homers), and even more encouraged to see Lee\u2019s K:BB (10 strikeouts to 7 walks) bounce right back. While nobody will claim Lee\u2019s first cup of coffee at AAA went exactly as they\u2019d hope, it also wasn\u2019t a catastrophic failure by any stretch.\n\nOverall it\u2019s hard to argue that Lee\u2019s 2023 was anything but a big success. After being drafted the year prior, Lee started out at AA right out of the gate, and mashed there pretty much all spring and into the summer until his promotion. Reaching AAA barely a year after being drafted is an incredible accomplishment. The Twins thought so highly of Lee\u2019s season that he was named their 2023 minor league hitter of the year. I also want to celebrate a full healthy season from Lee, too. He hasn\u2019t given us any reasons to be concerned about that, but it\u2019s always a bummer when a top prospect comes down with something and it sets back his development curve. Where we sit now, there\u2019s no reason not to still be very excited about Lee\u2019s prospects, and it\u2019s looking increasingly likely that we\u2019ll see him up at Target Field sometime next year.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nWith Lee, we\u2019re past the point of having to wonder if he\u2019s going to make it to the majors someday (and I don\u2019t want to gloss over that being a big win), and instead we can feel comfortable putting more effort into thinking about how far he may be able to go in the majors. Lee has always been labeled as a high floor prospect (not with the implication there\u2019s not real upside, too), and I do still feel that\u2019s an accurate label. But I also think there\u2019s still legit high upside here too. There\u2019s a few things I want to check on in this section while we try to predict if Lee\u2019s \u201conly\u201d going to be a solid everyday player, or if there\u2019s much more than that in store.\n\nThe biggest thing that I\u2019m interested to see continue to develop is Lee\u2019s switch hitting splits. Lee\u2019s top rated scouting grade has always been his hit tool, praised for fantastic contact skills from both sides of the plate. And last year, that was unquestioned with great lines on both sides (.274/.378/.441 batting righty, and .381/.458/.476 from the left side). But this year we saw a big divergence. He was still very good from the right side, hitting .287/.366/.494, but his LHH splits fell off a cliff, managing just .231/.266/.337. 51 of Lee\u2019s extra base hits this year also came as a righty, compared to just 7 as a lefty. I love switch hitters as they provide a natural safeguard against falling into platoon territory, which not only severely limits an individual player\u2019s upside, but I feel is also threatening the Twins currently lineup by too many guys being ineffective against certain handed pitchers. I wouldn\u2019t take this to be a screaming major red flag for Lee yet, as he only got a 100 PA sample size from the left side this season, and given this hasn\u2019t been raised as a concern in any of his historical scouting reports. Unfortunately Baseball Reference doesn\u2019t let us drill into minor league splits to see how Lee fared as a LHH in AA vs AAA, or as the season went on. I\u2019d love to do a deeper dive and get more data. But while I don\u2019t think there\u2019s reason to panic yet, I do see this as the biggest threat to Lee\u2019s ceiling.\n\nNext, it\u2019s been interesting to track his power output. Lee has always been more of a doubles hitter than homer guy, and that\u2019s held true this year as well, with 39 doubles to 16 homers in 125 games. Those rates are pretty equivalent to what we might have guessed looking at his collegiate stats and short stint last year. That\u2019s certainly going to play in the majors even if he holds at a 40/20 type guy. It just changes the type of player to expect a little bit. Think of a healthy Jorge Polanco type, usually good for 30+ doubles, but probably topping out at the 20ish home run range, rather than a higher power peak Brian Dozier type that is in the 30/30 or 40/30 range. Being a 20 HR type guy rather than a 30 HR type guy does seem like it lowers a potential ceiling by a non-insignificant amount. But a 40/20 guy is still an awesome everyday bat in the lineup, let\u2019s not be too harsh. Turning 23 in February, it\u2019s not as if Lee has no shot of adding power anymore, so I\u2019m curious if he does ever push the homer numbers a little higher. But that would likely come at the expense of some average/OBP skill, and honestly I\u2019d rather keep Lee where he\u2019s at and forfeit a potential extra 10 homers. Either way, this is one area that feels like it may have a little variability left.\n\nFinally, the last major question we all know has surrounded Lee for some time now is if he\u2019ll be able to stick at shortstop in the majors. Of course, with Carlos Correa (who, by the way, is [on the record](https://twitter.com/dohyoungpark/status/1631017450576793602) as being very high on Lee) now under contract for the next decade, this is a far lesser concern than it was a year ago, and perhaps now the right question is how well can Lee handle third base instead of shortstop. But being able to handle the hardest infield position if nothing else provides more value and flexibility, so I think it\u2019s still worth touching on here even if we won\u2019t be able to go very far with it due to lack of access (and existence) of quality defensive data in the minor leagues. Now with all that said, so far it seems the Twins are still confident that Lee can handle short. Last year he played exclusively at SS, and this year he had 111 games at short compared to 7 at third and 6 as DH. It does jump out that Lee had a whopping 19 errors at short in those 111 games. That would have been among the MLB\u2019s most errors of any qualified fielder at any position and in far fewer changes. We know better by now than to treat errors as gospel \u2013 they don\u2019t give any visibility into how difficult the play may have been, who\u2019s fault the error truly was, and it\u2019s all up to the official scorer how to rule a play so there\u2019s a human factor there too. And heck, Anthony Volpe just won a Gold Glove this year with 17 errors. Without anything more concrete to go off of here, we\u2019ll have to fall back on scouting reports again and take solace that he\u2019s given credit for great hands and a solid arm, with range being his limiting factor. I\u2019ve even seen reports that think he could be a Gold Glover if he does switch to third. At any rate, at the end of the day, Correa\u2019s presence on the Twins makes sticking at short far less important for Lee, and it seems likely that 3B will be his spot in the majors. But as with all prospects, defense will remain something to watch.\n\n# Highlights/film room\n\n* [Singles in first MLB spring training at-bat](https://twitter.com/FLProspectPod/status/1629550795937968128)\n* [First AA home run](https://twitter.com/sullyengels/status/1646325506181156864)\n* [Moonshot caps off 4-6 day for Wind Surge](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1684303994238238721)\n* [First AAA hit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofj33SEbfuc&amp;ab_channel=MinorLeagueBaseball)\n* [445 foot blast for first AAA home run](https://twitter.com/MiLB/status/1690243345170468864)\n* [4-hit night at the plate in St Paul](https://twitter.com/MiLB/status/1698562809796157809)\n* [September grand slam for the Saints](https://twitter.com/MiLB/status/1699246723150020998)\n* [No doubter home run](https://twitter.com/MLBPipeline/status/1704673618440192280)\n\n-----------------------\n\n# Noah Cardenas\n\n-----------------------\n\n# A refresher\n\nCardenas is a 24-year old catcher out of UCLA. The Twins acquired him in the 2021 draft (round 8, pick 249 overall). Cardenas\u2019 scouting grades:\n\nHit | Power | Run | Arm | Field | Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n45 | 40 | 40 | 60 | 60 | 40\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | G | AB | H | 2B | HR | RBI | SB | K | BB | AVG | OBP | SLG | wRC+\n:-- | :-- |  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nA+ | 90 | 309 | 84 | 23 | 3 | 38 | 9 | 77 | 55 | .272 | .397 | .382 | 127\nTotal | 90 | 309 | 84 | 23 | 3 | 38 | 9 | 77 | 55 | .272 | .397 | .382 | 127\n\n# The recap\n\nAfter spending the entirety of 2022, his first full year of minor league ball, at Fort Myers, Cardenas this year would spend the full season in Cedar Rapids. Cardenas was scouted as a defense first catcher with below average power but good on base skills, and that pretty much describes his year with the Kernels. He posted a great OBP of .397 despite hitting only .272 and just 3 homers \u2013 it\u2019s always a fun happenstance when a player has a higher OBP than SLG. Cardenas struck out 77 times for a solid 20.4% rate, but he really makes headlines with his walk rate, which with 55 walks this year was an elite 14.6%. And that\u2019s actually down a ways from his 2022 mark of 18.2% with 73 walks in 400 plate appearances! For a little context, Juan Soto led the league with an 18.6% walk rate this year, and only 3 qualified hitters had walk rates over 15%. On the defensive side, he threw out 31% of baserunners attempting to steal, right in line with his 29% mark from 2022, and a firm affirmation of his high arm grade. This is another elite mark \u2013 in the majors this year, only one catcher (min 300 innings) matched Cardenas\u2019 31% caught stealing mark, and only 5 catchers had a caught stealing rate over 25%.\n\nI wish I had more to say about Cardenas here, but I\u2019m not able to speak to more details on the defensive side of the game, and Cardenas\u2019 offense is unremarkable after you cover his great OBP. He doesn\u2019t have a tendency of putting together long hitting streaks, but he doesn\u2019t go more than a few games without a hit either. He rarely records more than 2 hits in a game, but also has fairly little over the fence power. 23 doubles in 90 games is a nice mark, but even those seem to be almost boringly scattered throughout the season instead of coming in bunches \u2013 not saying that\u2019s a bad thing. At the end of the day, knowing the type of player Cardenas is, in my opinion I\u2019d say he had a successful season. He posted a similar offensive line while moving up a level, and by all accounts his defense followed as well.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nCardenas feels like a definite floor over ceiling guy to me, in a non-disparaging way. Without more going on at the plate, it\u2019s hard to get too excited about Cardenas, but even an empty .260 average would play in the majors with how desolate catcher offense can be. It\u2019s a great sign that Cardenas posted another year with a strong K/BB, as that has proven to be fairly predictive. If Cardenas can continue to put up .390+ OBP marks, even if it comes with no power and maybe 20 doubles, you\u2019ll take that from a catcher slot. Especially when it\u2019s paired with strong defensive play. It sounds like Cardenas has it figured out off the field as well \u2013 he was named one of the Twins [Harmon Killebrew award winners](https://www.mlb.com/press-release/press-release-twins-announce-2022-harmon-killebrew-award-winners) in 2022 for outstanding community service, and is known for signing up for a bunch of volunteer opportunities as they come up.\n\nIn terms of timelines and looking at potential, 2024 is going to be a big year for Cardenas. He turned 24 this September, and he\u2019s been just a little on the older side for both his stays at A and A+, at nearly 1 year older than the average player. With a solid full season at A+ under his belt, it\u2019ll be time to jump up to AA and see how he handles things. We\u2019ll want to hear continued praise of his defensive game, as that\u2019s his clearest path to the majors. And honestly, if he keeps that up, he has a future as an MLB catcher even if only a backup.\n\nIf we hope/plan for a continued high floor defensively, then it comes down to what offensive progression we\u2019ll be able to wring out of Cardenas. A+ to AA is a big jump, and offensively we\u2019ll again want to be able to fall back on a strong K/BB. If that holds, that goes a long ways to propping up his floor, whereas if that takes a step back, that\u2019d be pretty damaging to his chances of reaching the majors. Looking at power potential is a low hanging fruit but obvious thing to watch, too. With only 3 homers in nearly 400 plate appearances this year, we\u2019re not expecting even 20 home run power in the future from Cardenas. But he did hit 9 homers in 400 PAs in 2022, so it\u2019s not necessarily that he\u2019s devoid of all power whatsoever. 2024 should be telling if we can have hope for Cardenas to be even a 15 homer bat in the future or not.\n\nAs things stand now, by all accounts Cardenas has a path to the majors based solely on his defense alone. Whether he projects as a low end backup or something closer to a time share remains to be seen and is likely dependent on how his offense develops. Making the presumptive jump to AA next year will give us a really good reality check on where Cardenas\u2019 progression stands, so even partway through next year we should be able to revisit this with a higher level of confidence. At this point in time, should all continue to go well, I\u2019d still expect Cardenas to be in the minors until at least 2026. While I won\u2019t advocate for getting super excited about Cardenas at this point, I definitely think he\u2019s worth keeping in the back of our minds as at least a possible backup catcher option in a few years.\n\n# Highlights/film room\n\nThere really isn\u2019t much out there on Cardenas during his time in the minors, so this section is going to be pretty light. Most all of what I\u2019m seeing stems back to his UCLA days and is geared towards his MLB draft scouting, so that will have to do for now:\n\n* [Prospect Pipeline draft profile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pPNIFxc0S8&amp;ab_channel=TheProspectPipeline)\n* [Home run at UCLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ixtFpo4tA&amp;ab_channel=TheProspectPipeline)\n* [Cardenas game highlights from 2019 UCLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBhV30VKZRY&amp;ab_channel=Lowandoutside)", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9998}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Happy Birthday to Capt.

Jenkins\u2019 scouting grades:\n\nHit | Power | Run | Arm | Field | Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n60 | 60 | 55 | 60 | 55 | 60\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | G | AB | H | 2B | HR | RBI | SB | K | BB | AVG | OBP | SLG | wRC+\n:-- | :-- |  :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nRookie | 14 | 54 | 18 | 3 | 2 | 12 | 4 | 8 | 5 | .333 | .390 | .537 | 138\nA | 12 | 51 | 20 | 2 | 1 | 10 | 2 | 6 | 4 | .392 | .446 | .608 | 182\nTotal | 26 | 105 | 38 | 5 | 3 | 22 | 6 | 14 | 9 | .362 | .417 | .571 | \n\n# The recap\n\nJenkins has by far the most excitement around him of any prospect in the Twins system, and rightfully so, but this recap is going to be on the shorter end for the simple reason that Jenkins only got 26 games after being drafted this summer. There\u2019s not great reason to read too far into such a small sample size \u2013 but let\u2019s go ahead and do a bit of that anyways :)\n\nJenkins\u2019 professional debut started with a bang, with a 2-4 day at the plate in his first game with the FCL Twins, including a double and a steal. That set the tone for his short stay in the rookie league, as in his 14 games there, he recorded 6 multi-hit games to just 2 hitless games. Jenkins totaled nearly as many extra base hits (6) as strikeouts (8), and the Twins had seen enough after just 2 and a half weeks to give him a promotion to A ball to close out the year. There, if you can believe it, Jenkins performed even better. After going 0-4 in his A ball debut, Jenkins rattled off an 8 game hit streak where he went 17 for 34 with 2 doubles, 2 triples, and a home run \u2013 good for a .500/.541/.765 slash over that span. His hit streak was snapped in his 3rd to last game of the year with an 0-3 day, but he recorded hits in both of his remaining 2 games, including another triple in his final outing. Overall he posted a bonkers 182 wRC+ in his 12 games with Fort Myers, putting a great cap on a wonderful introduction to Twins territory.\n\nSimply put, Jenkins\u2019 professional debut was better than anyone could have asked for. The numbers above speak for themselves \u2013 combined, he hit over .360 with a great mix of singles, doubles, homers, and even 4 triples, all while using the full field. He had a miniscule K rate of 12% and drew 9 walks in 26 games. He even stole 6 bags, though he did get caught stealing 3 times. It was an electric start to his pro career and showed exactly why he was one of the players in conversation for the 1st overall pick in a strong top heavy draft.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nWe should continue to be incredibly excited about Jenkins and eagerly look forward to what he can accomplish in his first full season next year. With that said, we do need to remember that he\u2019s only turning 19 in February and is probably going to need multiple years of seasoning in the minors before being ready for the majors \u2013 On average, first round picks out of high school have spent 4 to 4.5 years in the minors before their MLB debut. That\u2019s nothing to be concerned about, it\u2019s just a reality to keep in mind. It\u2019d be easy to look at Brooks Lee, for example, who played with AA in the playoffs last year after being drafted earlier that summer, and think Jenkins could follow a similar path, but remember Lee was a college prospect and is almost exactly 4 years older than Jenkins. I\u2019d expect Jenkins spends most if not all of 2024 at A/A+, perhaps getting a late season call-up to AA if he continues to mash consistently. Either way, we\u2019d hope to see him in AA for the bulk of 2025, which could perhaps set up a debut sometime in 2026.\n\nAs for what we should be looking for from Jenkins next season, let\u2019s simply sit back and see what he does in a full season of pro ball. He certainly didn\u2019t show much of any weaknesses in his quick stints this year, and there\u2019s no obvious things to pay special attention to that don\u2019t hold true for anybody else \u2013 K rate and BB rate continue to be important indicators of success, so we\u2019ll hope to continues to see strong numbers there. We\u2019ll be wanting to see continued strong power numbers as Jenkins settles into the professional wood bat setting. And 2024 should give us our first real indication of where Jenkins fits defensively \u2013 Jenkins got the majority of his reps at DH, though he did get 10 games in center. But we\u2019ll of course need much more time to get a sense for how he holds down fort there before even thinking about projecting if he may need to switch to a corner outfield position someday. The one more unique thing I\u2019ll put out there that I\u2019ll be watching in 2024 is his spray chart. Jenkins was scouted as having full field power, and that certainly held true in rookie ball has he went 32.6%/26.1%/41.3% pull/center/oppo. But then in A ball we saw a bit of a jump in his pull rate, with the percentages changing to 40.0%/28.9%/31.1%. None of that is at all concerning, particularly with such a small sample size, and a 40% pull rate still would have ranked pretty middle of the pack in the MLB this year. I\u2019m mostly hoping to \\*not* see another tick up in pull rate, which could serve as a first warning sign that Jenkins may not be as full field as we\u2019d hope. Again, that\u2019s a really minor concern right now, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ll pick out amongst a really great profile at this point.\n\nOverall, expect it to still be a multi-year journey to Target Field for Jenkins, but he has met and exceeded all expectations of a high 1st round pick so far, and he is still firmly on track to be a future star.\n\n# Highlights/film room\n\n* [Early post-draft interview](https://twitter.com/DWolfsonKSTP/status/1678242766545887236)\n* [Introductory press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uYYZexerGA&amp;ab_channel=MinnesotaTwins)\n* [Grand slam for first professional home run](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1688722436538195968)\n* [Full at-bat against Paul Skenes (ends in strikeout)](https://twitter.com/Rumorxli/status/1689679705677471758)\n* [Single off Paul Skenes in next at-bat](https://twitter.com/TwinsCentral1/status/1689685759702310918)\n* [Walkoff single in his second game with Fort Myers](https://twitter.com/milb_central/status/1695394173199724972)\n* [2-run triple for Fort Myers](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1699462786311389271)\n* [Named Florida State League minor league hitter of the week](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1698745674609606907)\n\n-----------------------\n\n# Andrew Morris\n\n-----------------------\n\n# A refresher\n\nMorris is a 22-year old RHP out of Texas Tech. The Twins acquired him in the 2022 draft (round 4, pick 114 overall). Morris\u2019 scouting grades:\n\nFastball | Curveball | Slider | Changeup | Control| Overall\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\n55 | 45 | 55 | 45 | 55 | 40\n\n\n# The stats\n\nLevel | W | L | ERA | FIP | IP | H | ER | BB | K | WHIP\n:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--\nA | 3 | 1 | 2.59 | 3.04 | 48.2 | 40 | 14 | 11 | 51 | 1.048\nA+ | 5 | 1 | 3.28 | 3.34 | 35.2 | 46 | 13 | 8 | 28 | 1.514\nTotal | 8 | 2 | 2.88 | x | 84.1 | 86 | 24 | 19 | 79 | 1.245\n\n# The recap\n\nMorris technically made his professional debut in 2022, but that was in a single shutout inning at rookie ball, along with one scoreless 3-inning outing for Fort Myers in A ball playoffs. The Twins started Morris out back in Fort Myers this year, where he made just one start (3 ER in 4.1 innings with 7 strikeouts on 61 pitches) before landing on the injured list with bicep tendonitis. He spent about a month on the IL, but didn\u2019t need much time to build back up to where he left off, throwing 44 pitches in his first start back, then setting a new season high with 69 pitches in his next start. He was able to stay injury free for the rest of the season, earning a promotion to A+ Cedar Rapids at the end of July following a 6 inning, 8 strikeout performance. Morris\u2019 A ball tenure this year ended with a 2.59 ERA across just under 50 innings, with 51 strikeouts to 11 walks.\n\nMorris had a bit of an unfriendly welcome to A+, giving up 10 hits and 4 earned runs in 5 innings in his first start for the Kernels. He was able to calm things down a bit though pretty quickly after, though, posting a 2.64 ERA over his next and final 6 starts, giving up 36 hits in 30.2 innings, along with 26 strikeouts to 8 walks. Combined across A and A+, Morris made 17 starts, throwing 84.1 innings and 79 strikeouts to 19 walks with a 2.88 ERA. It was a pretty solid showing for Morris\u2019 first real professional action.\n\n# Looking forward\n\nMorris was scouted as a floor rather than ceiling type arm, and so far that\u2019s turned out to look like an accurate label. Morris sits in the low 90s and tops out at about 96, so he doesn\u2019t have overpowering stuff, but a unique delivery lets him get a little more out of it than you might expect. Morris\u2019 slider is his only other pitch that has graded above average, so it\u2019s not surprising to see a lack of big strikeout numbers thus far. Still, Morris has struck out 80 in 85 innings as a professional, so he\u2019s not far behind the magic 9.0 K/9 benchmark. Morris\u2019 calling card this year was his great command, with a 2.0 BB/9 playing a big factor in Morris being able to be effective. For a little context, only 7 qualified MLB starters put up a better BB/9 total this season. I\u2019m also very impressed by Morris only giving up 4 homers all year, good for a miniscule 0.4 HR/9. For another big league comparison, Sonny Gray\u2019s 0.39 was the only mark to come close to Morris\u2019 this year, with the next closest (Justin Steele) recording 0.73 HR/9.\n\nWith that said, Morris still gave up way too many baserunners this year. His 9.2 H/9 would have ranked among the top 5 worst marks in the MLB this year, alongside the likes of Kyle Gibson and Lance Lynn. That metric will need to come down if Morris is to reach the majors in any notable role. Development of his secondary pitches is going to be critical to help bring his hits allowed back down. He\u2019s not working with a terrible starting point \u2013 great control and home run suppression are two skills that can be hard to develop, so it\u2019s great he has those under wraps already. But he\u2019s going to have to develop his secondary pitches further to help out on all fronts. That\u2019s really the key thing I\u2019ll be looking for from Morris in 2024, is what he\u2019s able to do with his arsenal. Adding a few ticks on his fastball would help a lot, but he also needs to have more consistent secondary pitch/es in order to be effective long term.\n\nTo that note, I\u2019m actually not super concerned with how his numbers shake out to start the 2024 season. He\u2019ll likely need to do some experimenting with pitch design and such, so I\u2019m willing to give him some time to grow before the results need to follow. I\u2019ll be more interested to hear from the org and scouts on how those pitches individually are developing. Back at A+ will be a good place for him to work on this, and from there he\u2019ll need to let the process results dictate how he progresses. I can\u2019t feel like we\u2019d be setting him up for success if we promote him to AA before we start to see more development out of his arsenal, so I\u2019d probably expect anywhere from a half to a full season at A+ before we think about a promotion to AA. Morris is so far off from the majors (both in terms of standard timeline and development) that I don\u2019t even want to look at his timeline past that, but he is still only 21, so he has time to figure it out. But his path to the majors will involve shoring up his arsenal and doing a better job at limiting hits, while retaining his great walk and home run rates. Unless he absolutely wows us with multiple pitches vastly improved, it\u2019s hard to see high level upside at this point. But you can definitely see a path to a serviceable back end rotation arm here. If Morris is able to follow that type of progression, he can be a guy that probably doesn\u2019t get much love on the scouting reports, but that we should keep in mind as a legitimate big league contributor, a la what we\u2019ve felt about Bailey Ober over the last year or two \u2013 someone who doesn\u2019t come close to the top of any of our org rankings, but someone who we feel good about contributing in the majors nevertheless. \n\n# Highlights/film room\n\n* [Tom Froemming system recap featuring Morris](https://youtu.be/6Ikxz_T3MSc?si=3aekkU-M9b7z7Dwp&amp;t=38)\n* [Leading the way to a strong pitching night from the Kernels with 7 strikeouts in 5 innings](https://twitter.com/TwinsPlayerDev/status/1692590569002840190)", "date": "20231119", "sentiment": 0.9997}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Autograph help please!

When thinking about the next Twins season, every winter, I used to think about how blessed we were to have a real hometown guy as our play-by-play man. I still don\u2019t know how to feel but I know it feels as though I\u2019ve lost a close uncle. Someone I share a hidden love with and someone who can only share his love, with his amazing voice, with me. Not like he cared all too often to be on screen, he knew his role so well, you could\u2019ve set a clock. Before we ever got a glimpse of him for too long, he\u2019d be back to the action and pretty much *demanding* our eyes be drawn to the field again, just as his. \nHis \u2018goodbye\u2019 was over before I could hold off tears myself, but I\u2019m so grateful Justin could help send him off, unknowingly to us. I got to shake his hand one year, must\u2019ve been 2005. I coached a youth baseball team and was able to go to some kind of brunch before the Twins took my team to a game for free. I had 8 or 9 kids with me, barely an adult. It made such an impact on me. \n\nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t have *much* of a moral compass until I volunteered to coach for college credit that summer. I didn\u2019t have a big father figure but the barely one I did, had Dick on in the house. So for much of being a young adult, I just kind of wavered from job to job, not knowing where to go or what to do with my life. But there was always that consistency. Twins baseball, summer, Dick making the call in the background.\nHe was a measure of consistency for us. 40 MLB Seasons, if you didn\u2019t know. Unless you got to hear Prime Dick Bremer, when the Twins were on the brink of being Seliged from their beloved state; then you missed a little of his brilliance. Not that he even fell off, by no means. He just took our collective excitement, and gave us a mirror. He gathered Minnesotans in legendary fashion and upon our gathering, he called to us from such a familiar plane that we will certainly need time to recover. \n\nMuch like losing a loved one, and make no mistake, Twins territory and specks all over the world, will have all lost... He did us right, but we lost..? I just cannot bring myself to put goodbye to words yet. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll never read this or have anyone pass it along to you, but thank you, Dick. You made Twins baseball fun. You made Twins baseball witty. You made Twins baseball exciting. You made my heart roar. You made my soul love baseball, forever. You made me a lifelong fan. \n\nYOU did that, for all of us. \n\nMy favorite call was the Kubel homerun.", "date": "20231108", "sentiment": 0.9969}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Judge Harry Crump, who saved the Minnesota Twins from elimination by MLB, dies at 85 ", "date": "20231107", "sentiment": 0.4215}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Predictions for this offseason?

Adding any or multiple of these players would easily make the Yankees a 90+ win team next year, and possibly better if a few things break right.\n\nConsider some of the major items that went wrong last season:\n\n* Judge missed 2 months of the season due to a freak toe injury from running into a wall at Dodgers Stadium, while on pace for a 50-60 HR season again before the injury\n* Rizzo had a freak concussion on a pickoff play after having a .900 OPS in April and May, then played 2 months with it due to the team's incompetence while posting a .496 OPS over that span\n* Between Stanton, Severino, Cortes, and Rodon, the Yankees received -0.8 fWAR combined last year (12.4 fWAR combined in 2022). Severino is off the team now (-0.6 fWAR), and you have to think at least some of those remaining guys are going to bounce back next season given their ages and track records.\n* The Yankees got 0.1 fWAR combined out of LF last year, 4th worst in MLB (example upgrades: 5.5 fWAR from Soto last year, 4.1 fWAR from Bellinger)\n\nGiven that they have $125 million in luxury tax dollars tied up for a long time on aging veterans just barely still in their primes (Judge, Cole, Stanton, Rodon), the Yankees **desperately need to try to win right now**. This team is going to be **far worse in 3 or 4 years** when Judge and Cole start declining, no matter how many prospects you try to integrate into the roster. The only guys that should be untouchable in trades are Volpe and Dominguez, maybe King if you really believe in him as a SP.\n\nIf Soto signed an extension along with the trade, you'd be giving up Volpe and/or Dominguez for him. The only reason they can afford to make this move without depleting the system is that he's a rental. I wouldn't be upset one bit if Schmidt, Pereira, etc. were sent off for him given the team's long-term outlook.

He never fulfilled that lofty promise, but he did win World Series rings as a member of the 1998 and 1999 Yankees!  \n\nHappy birthday to [Ricardo Alberto Led\u00e9e](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/ledeeri01.shtml) (pronounced luh-DAY), born November 22, 1973, in Ponce, Puerto Rico. \n  \nDrafted as a 16-year-old, Ledee was a skinny singles hitter until he filled out into a 6'2\", 190-pound man and found his home run swing, with 22 home runs in A-ball in 1994 and 21 in just 96 games in Triple-A in 1996.\n  \nIn 1998, he hit .283/.378/.506 in Triple-A Columbus, then was called up to the Show when Bernie Williams went on the Disabled List with a sprained knee. In his major league debut on [June 14, 1998](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA199806140.shtml), Ledee had a single in his first at-bat, and later walked and stole a base, in a 4-2 win over the Cleveland Indians. The next day he had his first major league home run, a three-run home run down the left field line at Camden Yards off Scott Erickson.\n  \nThree weeks later, on [July 2](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA199807020.shtml), he walked off the Philadelphia Phillies with a bases loaded single off Jerry Spradlin in the bottom of the 11th for a 9-8 win. He hit .273/.360/.455 in June and .281/.324/.438 in July!\n  \nLedee returned to the minors when Bernie returned on July 18, but was back when rosters expanded in September. In his third game back, he went 2-for-4 with a double and an RBI in an 8-5 win over the Blue Jays. Unfortunately, those two hits accounted for half of the hits he'd have all month. He hit .160/.214/.280 in 28 plate appearances to end his rookie season on a sour note.\n\nOverall, he hit .241/.299/.392 (81 OPS+) in 87 plate appearances, good enough to get on the post-season roster. He didn't play in the first round three-game sweep of the Texas Rangers, and went 0-for-5 in the second round six-game win over the Cleveland Indians. In the World Series against the Padres, he platooned in left with Shane Spencer... and went 6-for-10 with three doubles, two walks, and four RBIs in the four-game sweep, [including a two-run double off Kevin Brown in Game 1](https://youtu.be/P7lR64xRtts?si=y9AYYOxo1RrAePgb)!\n\nThat got him into the mix for a spot in the Yankees crowded lineup in 1999. He was the Opening Day left fielder, hitting 7th, but over the first month of the season had just 10 more starts over the next two months, falling behind Chad Curtis and Shane Spencer in the left field pecking order.  \n\nHitting just .200/.245/.200 on May 9, he was sent down to Columbus for six weeks. He didn't exactly kill it down there -- he hit .252 with four home runs and 15 RBIs, and missed some time with an illness -- but on June 25, Curtis was hitting .214/.343/.330, Spencer was hitting .218/.299/.379, and May call-up Tony Tarasco (did you remember [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVNlvnsQ828) later became a Yankee?) was hitting .161/.229/.226.\n\nAnd so Tarasco was optioned to Triple-A and Ledee, now 25, returned to the Bronx.\n\n\u201cWe need to find out about him because he is out of options next year,\u201d GM Brian Cashman said. Ledee was determined to stick this time, saying he had a new attitude. \n\n&gt; \u201cI was defensive because I was thinking if I got a hit today, I would play tomorrow. Now, I don\u2019t care. If I go down, I will go down swinging. Whatever happens, happens. I have to be aggressive. I tried to guide the ball and it didn\u2019t work.\u201d -- Ricky Ledee\n\nLedee was only used once as a pinch runner his first week back, but on July 1 he got the start in a game against the Tigers, and went 2-for-3 with a walk and an RBI. He would have a monster July (.333/.357/.648 in 56 plate appearances) and an even better August (.371/.470/.643 in 83 plate appearances), and Yankee fans thought we had our next great outfielder. Alas, he again had a September swoon, hitting just .198/.283/.370 in the final month, but still... .276/.346/.476 in 280 plate appearances was promising.\n\nThat post-season he again was the left-handed half of a left field platoon. In the ALDS, another sweep of the Rangers, he went 3-for-11 with two doubles and two RBIs, and in the five-game win over the Red Sox in the ALCS, he had [a pinch-hit grand slam in the top of the 9th](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znZ7Zkh0a9A) off Rod Beck to put away Game 4. In the World Series sweep of the Braves, he was 2-for-10 with a double and an RBI.\n\nHeading into the 2000 season, the Yankees traded away Chad Curtis, set on a Spencer/Ledee platoon in left field. But at the end of April, Ledee was hitting .173/.279/.269 and Spencer .222/.260/.431. The Yankees started looking for a veteran outfielder. They couldn't agree on a package with the Cubs for Sammy Sosa, and had a deal with the Tigers in place to acquire Juan Gonzalez but he vetoed the trade.\n\nThe trigger was finally pulled on a deal for David Justice, with Ledee, Zach Day, and Jake Westbrook going to the Indians. Ledee cried when he got the news that the Yankees had traded him away.\n\n&gt; \"I was sad, I was very sad. It was tough for me to say goodbye to everyone. To be honest, I cried. I cried all night because (the Yankees) were the team I wanted to play for.\" -- Ricky Ledee\n\nThe 34-year-old Justice hit an impressive .305/.391/.585 (3.2 bWAR) in 78 games with the Yankees and was the ALCS MVP, while Ledee lasted just a month in Cleveland before being dealt to Texas for David Segui. To put it another way, Justice was worth 3.2 bWAR in half a season with the Yankees; Ledee's entire seven-year post-Yankee career was worth 1.5 bWAR. Zach Day lasted five years in the bigs as a swingman and went 21-27 with a 4.66 ERA (96 ERA+) for 1.9 bWAR. But the real steal of the deal was Jake Westbrook, who was 105-103 with a 4.32 ERA (96 ERA+) for 13.1 bWAR over a 13-year career.\n\nAfter the Yankees, Ledee played for the Indians, Rangers, Phillies, Giants, Dodgers, and Mets -- a total of seven teams over a 10-year career. He hit .243/.325/.412 (91 OPS+) in 2,307 plate appearances, and .295/.360/.500 in 50 post-season plate appearances, all with the Yankees.\n\nHe only had one season with more than 300 plate appearances -- 2000, when he hit .236/.322/.381 in 531 plate appearances split between the Yankees, Indians, and Rangers. His best numbers came in his two and a half seasons with the Phillies, hitting .248/.350/.463 in 677 plate appearances.\n\nA chronic hamstring injury limited his availability and he retired at age 33 after splitting the 2007 season between the Mets and Triple-A New Orleans. [His 63rd and final career home run came in a Mets uniform](https://x.com/GershOnline/status/1671137172966240257?s=20), with manager Willie Randolph approving from the dugout.\n\n**All The Way Ledee:**  \n \n* Ledee \"has a picturesque stroke, a rocket arm and [the good looks](https://mlblogspinstripebirthdays.files.wordpress.com/2009/11/ricky2bledee.jpg) to be the newest tenant on *Melrose Place*,\" Jack Curry wrote in *The New York Times* in 1998. He never made it to *Melrose Place,* but he was in the 1999 movie *For Love of the Game*, with Kevin Costner as a pitcher in his final career start. Ledee plays \"Ruiz.\"  \n\n* Ricky wore [\\#38](https://ansel.frgimages.com/oakland-athletics/ricky-ledee-upper-deck-sp-top-prospects-number-rl-autograph-card_ss2_p-12889359+u-1h7xsnq6rgw5cjfeery8+v-9d1e8f07322549bcae7bbf19c6b673d1.jpg) when he first came up to the Yankees, then switched to [\\#17](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BpmdzkGcoxr77Pw_vx9k1h_zjPg=/0x0:2366x3499/920x613/filters:focal(699x943:1077x1321):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/62346978/72567428.jpg.0.jpg). \\#38 is currently worn by Ben Rortvedt; before him, those who wore it for three or more seasons were Randy Choate (2001-2003), Matt Nokes (1990-1994), Steve Kline (1970-1974), Art Shallock (1953-1955), Johnny Hopp (1950-1952), and Gus Niarhos (1948-1950), but the longest to wear it was Johnny Blanchard (1955-1965).  \n\n* As for \\#17, Aaron Boone has worn it since becoming Yankee manager... even though he wore \\#19 when he was a player on the Yankees. Boone wore \\#17 with the Reds, but when he came to the Yankees, the number already was assigned to John Flaherty, so Boone switched to \\#19. After Boone left the Yankees for the Indians, he went back to \\#17. When he was hired as Yankees manager in 2018, Masahiro Tanaka was wearing \\#19, so Boone took the now-vacant \\#17. Therefore no player has worn \\#17 since Matt Holliday had it in 2017. Other notable \\#17's were Shelley Duncan (2007-2008), Gerald Williams (2001-2002), Kenny Rogers (1996-1997), Oscar Gamble (1976-1979), Gene Michael (1968-1974), Enos Slaughter (1954-1959), and [previously forgotten Yankee Vic Raschi](https://np.reddit.com/r/NYYankees/comments/ptuvnt/no_game_today_so_lets_remember_a_forgotten_yankee/) (1947-1953).  \n\n* Twenty-seven major leaguers were born in Ponce, including Hall of Famers Roberto Alomar and Orlando Cepeda. Other Yankees from Ponce include 1982 infielder Edwin Rodriguez, 2004 All-Star Javier Vazquez, and 1970s first baseman/outfielder Otto Velez.  \n\n* Ricky was just 12 years old when his father, 35-year-old To\u00f1ito Ledee, was killed in a car accident. To\u00f1ito was the lead singer of [La Sonora Ponce\u00f1a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Sonora_Ponce%C3%B1a) -- here he is singing [\"Sentimiento Jibaro\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb-YuXcY2-8) in 1978. After his father's death, Ledee gave up baseball for a time because playing reminded him too much of his father. \"I didn't play for a long, long time,\" Ledee told Jack Curry in 1998. \"He was the one who wanted me to play. He was a singer and he didn't want me doing that. He pushed me to play baseball. When he died, I couldn't play anymore.\" He eventually returned to baseball as a way to honor his father's memory.  \n\n* Ricky was signed by Yankee scout Luis Arroyo, who also pitched for the Yankees from 1960 to 1963. Most notably, he was the closer on the 1961 Yankees, leading the majors with 29 saves. Whitey Ford won the Cy Young Award that year and when he gave his acceptance speech, he spoke for seven minutes, then asked Arroyo to speak for two more minutes!  \n\n* During Spring Training 2000, the *New York Daily News* reported that Joe Torre would shout \"Ricky, growl!\" at Ledee as he left the dugout for the on-deck circle. \"I didn't know exactly what that meant,\" Ledee said. \"But I knew what he wanted.\" Torre told the newspaper he wanted Ledee to be more aggressive at the plate. Torre believed Ricky was too passive, waiting for the perfect pitch to hit, and often it never came. \"It was, 'You've got this at-bat, do something with it.' I don't want three pitches and out,\" Torre said. The growl worked: Ledee hit .351 that spring and led the team in home runs (7), extra base hits (14), and runs scored (21).\n  \n* Ledee, like his fellow Puerto Rican Bernie Williams, didn't play with the same visible intensity as teammates Paul O'Neill or Roger Clemens. In 1999, Ricky told Buster Olney, then with *The New York Times*, that while Williams looked mellow, he was as competitive as anyone. \"[Bernie] hits a ball back to the pitcher and he runs as hard as he can. He hits an easy fly ball to center and he runs as hard as he can,\" Ledee said. \"He gets mad -- really mad -- when one of his teammates is hit by a pitch or is knocked down. He's really quiet, but he's intense when he plays. It's a great example when he plays.\"  \n\n* Speaking of Bernie, sportswriter Aaron McCarron said that Ledee was so soft-spoken in the clubhouse that sometimes he couldn't be heard above Williams softly strumming on his acoustic guitar.  \n\n* Ledee was frequently the target of trade rumors. It got so intense that when reporters were in the clubhouse talking to the Yankees, Ledee would question *them,* asking what they'd heard about possible deals. He was rumored to be going to the Phillies for Curt Schilling or Mickey Morandini, to the Expos for Pedro Martinez or Rondell White, to the Angels for Jim Edmonds or Darin Erstad, to the Cubs for Sammy Sosa, or to the Tigers for Juan Gonzalez.  \n\n* The rumored deal for Pedro was the Yankees giving up Ledee, Mariano Rivera, and Jorge Posada, but the Expos wanting more! In the end, the Expos traded Martinez -- due to be a free agent at the end of that season -- to the Red Sox for highly touted prospects Carl Pavano and Tony Armas Jr. The Red Sox immediately signed him to the then-richest contract for a pitcher in baseball history both in terms of total dollars and average salary -- $75 million over six years plus a $17 million seventh year option.  \n\n* The Twins asked for Ledee in the deal for Chuck Knoblauch; the Padres in the deal for the rights to Hideki Irabu; and the Blue Jays for Roger Clemens. All three of those deals got done without Ledee in the package.  \n\n* The Twins had asked the Yankees for Ledee, Ramiro Mendoza, and Jorge Posada in return for Knoblauch. \"They have to be realistic about what they're asking for,\" George Steinbrenner said in the winter of 1997-1998. \"I'm a great Knoblauch fan, but at what price?\" In the end, the Twins settled for Eric Milton, Brian Buchanan, Cristian Guzman, and Danny Mota in exchange for Knoblauch; the San Diego Padres got Rafael Medina, Ruben Rivera, and $3,000,000 for Irabu, Homer Bush, and minor leaguer Gordie Amerson; and the Blue Jays took Bush, Graeme Lloyd, and David Wells for Clemens.\n \n* \"The thing I want is to play for the Yankees -- bad,\" Ledee said as rumors were swirling. \"I can play with these guys. I love the Yankees. I don't care if I get traded the next day after they call me up. I just want one shot.\"\n \n* Ledee was finally traded, on June 29, 2000, to Cleveland for David Justice. As noted above, Justice had a great second half and an even better ALCS in his first year in pinstripes. But after putting up a 99 OPS+ in 2001, the Yankees traded Justice to the Mets for Robin Ventura, and the Mets immediately dealt him to the A's for Mark Guthrie and Tyler Yates. In the movie *Moneyball*, Justice reminds A's GM Billy Beane that he's paying him $7 million a year. \"Naw, man, I ain't paying you seven. The Yankees are paying half your salary. That's what the New York Yankees think of you. They're paying you three and a half million dollars to play *against* them.\" Apparently motivated, Justice rebounded to a 111 OPS+, then retired.\n \n* In the minors, Ledee's smooth left-handed line-drive stroke was often compared to Don Mattingly. After Mattingly became the Yankees' hitting coach, Ledee said he talked to Mattingly every day. \"Don gave me some good tips and drills to do. He taught me that little things that we sometimes don't pay attention to are important. He emphasized that and staying down on the ball. He knows a lot.\"\n\n* In 1998, *The New York Times* reported that Ledee bred roosters for cockfighting, which was legal in Puerto Rico until 2019. In 2005, the newspaper reported Ledee was now a horse breeder, with 30 paso fino horses, and was considering raising thoroughbreds.\n\n* On [July 18, 1999](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA199907180.shtml), David Cone threw a perfect game against the Montreal Expos... with some help from Ricky! Ledee hit [a two-run home run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS6yEs9OxLs) in the bottom of the 2nd to break a scoreless tie, then [battled the sun to make a running catch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97h87vgwdHY) for the second out in the 9th inning.\n\n* Ledee did it again with his bat and his glove as the starting center fielder for the Phillies on [April 27, 2003](https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI200304270.shtml), when Kevin Millwood threw a no-hitter against San Francisco Giants. Ledee not only provided the Phillies' only run with [a 1st inning home run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cuED1gGrMw) off Jesse Foppert, but preserved the no-no with [an over-the-shoulder leaping catch to rob Marquis Grissom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bGLiOm7I5o) in the 9th inning.\n\n* Ledee reached base the first seven times he came to the plate in the World Series! In Game 1 of the 1998 World Series, he had a 2nd inning two-run double, a 5th inning single, a 7th inning walk, and reached on an error in the 8th; in Game 2, he had a 2nd inning single, a 3rd inning RBI double, and a 5th inning walk. The Padres finally got him out in his 8th plate appearance, and it was on a line drive to Tony Gwynn in right field!\n\n* No wonder the Mets wanted to sign Ledee at the end of his career: He was an incredible .296/.408/.568 (.976 OPS) against Mets pitchers in 98 plate appearances. He particularly liked facing Pedro Astacio, who was with the Mets in 2002 and 2003. Ricky was 9-for-14 with 5 home runs and 5 walks (.643/.750/1.786) against him! \n\n* In 2007, Jack Curry, then of *The New York Times*, asked Ledee what he remembered about Derek Jeter's professional debut after the Yankees took him with the sixth overall pick in the 1992 draft. They were 18-year-old teammates that year on the Tampa Yankees. \"He stunk,\" Ledee told Curry. \"In the beginning, he stunk.\" In his debut, a doubleheader, Jeter went 0-for-7 with five strikeouts and a throwing error. He didn't get a hit until his 15th at-bat, Curry reported, and that was a bloop single. In 47 games for Tampa, he hit .202 and made 12 errors. But still, Ledee said, there was a glimmer. \"You could see everything was there,\" Ledee said. \"The bat speed was there. He stayed inside the ball and hit the ball the other way. The Jeter that I see now, he was the same then.\"\n\n* Gary Denbo, then a minor league hitting coach with the Yankees, remembered how Jeter and Ledee, each viewed as a can't-miss prospect, handled a bad night. Both would come out early for batting practice the next day, but Jeter would almost immediately regain his confidence. Ledee would remain frustrated and unsure of himself. \"It was an early insight into one player absolutely certain he was destined for greatness, Denbo thought, and another no less dedicated but lacking a similar self-confidence.\"\n\n* In 2013, [Buster Olney linked](https://twitter.com/buster_espn/status/296745960917303297?lang=en) to the Twitter account [@Ricky_Ledee](https://twitter.com/ricky_ledee).

Furthermore I\u2019ve seen some people say that while his jump throw and diving catches look flashy and impressive to the eye, they actually show his limited range and strength because a good shortstop would just make more routine plays. Basically Jeter was good when he got the ball, made the right throws and few errors, but was actually bad about getting to the ball and could be limited in his throwing ability.

With Charlie Morton turning 40 and Max Fried hitting free agency in 2025, the Braves are in the market for another potential frontline starter and have money to spend. Glasnow\u2019s injury history and the single year of control weigh his value down, but he\u2019s bonkers when healthy and 1/$25M probably strikes the front office as way more appealing than th 9-figure deal it would take to sign Nola or Snell. Plus the Braves love Rays castoffs (see Morton, d\u2019Arnaud, McHugh, Nick Anderson, even Kevan Smith for a minute). \n\nI hate when people use the BTV website as gospel but it\u2019s a decent starting point, I think, and it has the Glasnow contract as carrying $13.1M in surplus value. For reference, only two Braves prospects (AJ Smith-Shawver, Hurston Waldrep) rank higher. Those are also probably the only two prospects who would be untouchable in a Glasnow deal, especially since both will likely start games for the big-league club this year. \n\nAs for the rest of them, I could imagine a package built around one or two of Vaughn Grissom, Spencer Schwellenbach, or JR Ritchie. \n\nGrissom had a nice major league stint in 2022 but struggled at shortstop in 2023 and spent the bulk of the year in the minors. He absolutely raked in Triple-A, but with below average exit velocities. He can play a decent second base, but that position\u2019s blocked in our organization for a while so there\u2019s a decent chance he\u2019s on the move. \n\nSchwellenbach was a two-way player in Nebraska who the Braves have turned into a starting pitching prospect. He\u2019s built around a fastball-slider combo and he came on strong at the end of the year, but he\u2019ll be 24 in Double-A\n\nFinally, Ritchie was an overslot high school signing in 2022 who\u2019s been nails as a pro but is currently rehabbing from TJ. Probably the highest upside and the lowest floor of these three guys. \n\nCurious to get your thoughts on the sorts of prospects TB might prize at this point.", "date": "20231117", "sentiment": 0.9923}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Yandy vs Julio vs Tucker Yandy: 5.2 bWAR (8th among AL Position players), .330 Batting Average (won AL Batting title), .932 OPS (3rd in AL), 158 OPS+ (3rd in AL), 164 wRC+ (3rd in AL), 4.7 fWAR (12th among AL Position players), 137 games played\n\nJulio: 5.3 bWAR (T-6th among AL position players), .275 Batting Average (12th in AL), .818 OPS (11th in AL), 128 OPS+ (11th in AL), 126 wRC+ (10th in AL), 5.9 fWAR (4th among AL Position players), 155 games played\n\nTucker: 5.4 bWAR (5th among AL Position players), .284 batting Average (6th in AL), .886 OPS (4th in AL), 142 OPS+ (4th in AL), 140 wRC+ (4th in AL), 4.9 fWAR (9th among AL Position players), 157 games played\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a Yandy should\u2019ve been ahead of Julio and Tucker argument.

The Rays once again did very well, with less than a million dollars a win. The Mighty Mets meanwhile see each win cost its billionaire owner $4.6 million. \n\nSmart vs. Stupid: This is my sixth year measuring MLB team efficiencies: Payroll divided by victories. I use Spotrac for payroll, because it includes all paid players, even those no longer on the active roster.\n\nThis year\u2019s post-season was a bit weird: The big-win teams in the regular season \u2013 Braves, Dodgers, Orioles, Rays \u2013 collapsed in the playoffs, taken over by wild-card teams on hot streaks. \n\nThe big-spending Rangers -- $251 million payroll \u2013 paid $2.8 million per regular season victory.\n\nThe frugal D-backs spent $119 million, just a bit more than the Marlins\u2019 $105 M. The Snakes and Fish each had 84 wins in the regular season, Miami spending $1.25 M per win, Arizona $1.4 M (half as much as the Rangers). During the playoffs, Arizona got hot. The Fish did not.\n\nLooking back over the six years, what impresses me is that some teams are consistently smart on how they spend their money \u2013 and some teams are astoundingly stupid year after year.\n\nThe Rays regularly reach the playoffs despite low budgets caused by dreadful attendance. For the past four years, the Orioles have had good efficiency \u2013 low cost per win \u2013 and finally made the playoffs this year.\n\nThen there are the Pirates and A\u2019s: Great bargains in cost-per-win, but not a whiff of playoffs. Each spent roughly $1 million per win.\n\nContrast that with teams like the Angels and Mets, who consistently spend huge amounts for naught. This year, the five teams that spent the most per win didn\u2019t make the playoffs: Rockies ($2.9 million per win), Padres ($3.1 M), Angels ($3.15 M), Yankees ($3,4 M) and the Mets at an astonishing $4.6 million per win.\n\nThe Mets set an all-time record for payroll at $343 million, almost five times the Orioles\u2019 $71 million.\n\nThe Yanks at least made the playoffs five of the six years, though the top spot they always seek keeps eluding them. The Padres got there twice in the same period.  The Mets once. The Angels, determinedly bad in cost-per-wins year after year, have not been in the playoffs since 2014, perhaps an example of the old saying that insanity is doing the same thing again and again expecting different results.\n\nThe World Champ Rangers are an interesting case. They had the fourth highest payroll \u2013 behind only the Mets, Yankees and Padres. Yet $96M of their $251M was injured reserve, led by deGrom at $30 million. Seager ($35.5 million) was a major factor for their success, but so were Evan Carter (adjusted salary $89,033 because he had less than 100 AB when he came up at the end of the season), Josh Jung ($721,000), Leodys Taveras $733,000, Josh Sborz $733,000 and Adolis Garcia $747,000.

His last words were literally \u201cDid the Giants Win?\u201d\n\nThe Giants are part of life, so I have a lot of memorable moments watching but nothing more memorable than this one.\n\nIt was July of \u201897, I was 9 and this was the first and only game I would have the opportunity to go to as a kid, so I was pumped. It was a day game at candlestick against the Rockies in the middle of the week so the stands were pretty empty. \n\nWe bought tickets on the first base line, but during the stretch we decided to move to the left field line. The Giants had a good lead and I wanted see Barry Bonds up close. He was my second favorite player next to Willie Mays. I never saw Mays play, but I sure practiced the fuck out of a basket catch, but I digress.\n\nOne thing you have to know about my dad to appreciate this story is that he has absolutely no shame. He\u2019s loud, friendly, and very personable. Like go to jail, break all the unwritten rules and interact with every race friendly. That\u2019s another story though.\n\nSo we\u2019re out in left field now, and Barry is out there. At one point, in between batters, my dad nudges me and says, \u201cWatch this.\u201d He\u2019s stands up quickly and with childlike glee, he waves his hand way above his head and yells, \u201cSay hey Barry, say hey!!\u201d\n\nBarry snapped his head quick with a slight tilt, surprised and wanting to see where it was coming from.  Only to see my dad waving his hand like a big kid at him, and once again yelling \u201cSay hey!\u201d He smiled at him and shook his head in disbelief. Then gave a big wave back. \n\nYou could tell Barry really appreciated it, because he turned back to the game still smirking and shaking his head. \n\nIt was awesome and a Giants moment that I\u2019ll never forget.

(inspired by an r/baseball post) This is a question I've thought about posting before, but was finally spurred to do so by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/182x2rk/what_nonplayoff_season_from_your_teams_history/) on r/baseball. Thought it might generate some interesting discussion.\n\nFor context's sake, I was born in '98 and started following the team on a day-by-day basis around 2004. My answer to this question would probably 2009 or 2015.\n\n2009 was the Giants' first competitive and above .500 season since 2004. In hindsight, it was definitely an appropriate preview for what was to come in 2010. You had a lot of great individual performances, including Timmy's second Cy Young campaign and Pablo Sandoval's breakout season. Although the Giants didn't make the playoffs, the stretch run featured one of the best moments I've witnessed in-person: [Edgar Renteria's grand slam against the Rockies](https://youtu.be/s_kVHwVUOI8?si=UuYtCTd22Bdl1YhS). If the Giants had made the playoffs that season instead of Colorado, I feel like that home run would've been much more iconic (in the same vein as the Brian Johnson home run from '97).\n\nFor 2015, I don't have the stats to back me up, but, anecdotally, I feel like that team had one of the best offenses from the Bochy era. That was also one of those seasons where the Giants got weird at the trade deadline and added a good handful of \"*he* was a Giant?!?\" kind of guys. Think Mike Leake, Marlon Byrd, Alejandro De Aza, etc.. 2015 was also Timmy's final season as a Giant. And before he got hurt midway through the season, he had a few flashes of his old form, most notably [against the Bums on a foggy weeknight in May](https://youtu.be/cDo88smy7_o?si=HgRm3490KVeH-lH-).\n\nWhat would be your favorite Giants team(s) that didn't make the playoffs?", "date": "20231124", "sentiment": 0.9896}, {"ranking": 0.3620689655172414, "comments": "$5 Giants Tickets (No Fees) for 30+ Games in 2024 (Orange and Black Friday) FYI!", "date": "20231124", "sentiment": 0.4263}, {"ranking": 0.3620689655172414, "comments": "Season Ticket License So im thinking of doing something stupid like getting season tickets to the Giants.

The Giants were 23rd in Fangraphs WAR at the Starting Pitcher position. And while they were 7th for relievers, they also tailed off a bit in the second half. Regardless of strength, bullpens are always volatile and always worthy of some cheap upgrades.\n\nHere's a few options I really like that I think the Giants would like as well.    \n\n\n**Richard Bleier, LHP**\n\nBleier is the left-handed, normal throwing version of Tyler Rogers. You might think, wait, that\u2019s Taylor Rogers, his twin! But you\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s Richard Bleier. A weak-tossing lefty who rarely strikes batters out, Bleier is *the definition* of a \u201cpitch-to-contact pitcher.\u201d 2023 was a deviation for him, but Bleier is elite at missing barrels, which in the eyes of a front office, is sometimes just as good as getting a strikeout. He doesn\u2019t walk batters either\u2026 the point is, it\u2019s awfully tough to get on base against Bleier. He\u2019d be a fun pitcher to watch. \n\n**Adam Cimber, RHP**\n\nTo paraphrase Ke$ha, \u201cIt\u2019s going down, he\u2019s Adam Cimber!\u201d Cimber was very bad in 2023. Like, *really* bad. Giving up 6 HR in just 20 innings of pitching, the Blue Jays nontendered him. But the good news is that it\u2019s almost impossible for Cimber to maintain a 28.6% HR/FB rate. The question for Cimber is going to be if he can also get that walk rate down. Another reliever who has been very good at limiting barrels and inducing ground balls, Cimber is one of my bounce back candidates for 2024.\n\n**Jake Diekman, LHP**\n\nAs a Nebraskan, I am obligated to include at least one fellow Nebraskan when I get the chance. Diekman is an interesting pitcher. He\u2019s one of the best strikeout pitchers in the game, but he\u2019s also got one of the worst walk rates to match it. Add in some troubles in recent years with the long ball, and Jake Diekman may be the pitchers version of Joey Gallo.\n\nIf the Giants believe they could lower the walk rate like Tampa Bay did, there\u2019s a solid pitcher in there.\n\n**Dylan Floro, RHP**\n\nIf you judge by only the ERA, Floro had a rough season in 2023. But behind that ERA, you have an unsustainable .401 BABIP, which is going to come back to earth. Floro gives a good strikeout rate and a good walk rate. He keeps the ball in the yard. He even puts the ball on the ground. His first season of free agent eligibility, Floro seems like a great option for the Giants if they want more bullpen help.\n\n**Shintaro Fujinami, RHP**\n\nFor all the talk of players jumping the Pacific Ocean, we forget about an option that made the jump last year. Fujinami was awful with the Athletics, but the Orioles saw something they liked, traded for him and now, he\u2019s a free agent. Fujinami offers a fastball with elite velocity with a good whiff rate. The Giants would need to hone in on some of the secondary pitches, but Fujinami would be a good addition for the right price. \n\n**Phil Maton, RHP**\n\nMaton might be the best pitcher on this list. There\u2019s not a lot of things to write: he strikes batters out, doesn\u2019t walk a ton, and keeps the ball in the yard. There\u2019s more red on his Statcast than a Texas Congressional Map, but unlike the comparison, that\u2019s a good thing. Maton is elite at limiting hard contact, which is really good for a fly-ball pitcher. He\u2019d fit the back of the Giants bullpen well.\n\n**Robert Stephenson, RHP**\n\nYou could argue that Stephenson is a better option than Phil Maton. And while I think he\u2019d be a fine signing by the Giants, I\u2019m concerned about sustainability. Stephenson had been pretty bad for a few years, went to Tampa Bay and was no longer \u201cpretty bad.\u201d Quite the opposite, in fact. The Rays got the most out of Stephenson and there\u2019s some intrigue to see if they, indeed, fixed him or if it was only temporary. I\u2019m worried it might be temporary, but for the right deal, I\u2019d be okay finding out.\n\n**Brent Suter, LHP**\n\nIt would be unfair of me to list Richard Bleier, but not Brent Suter, because they are similar. While Suter strikes out batters at a better rate, he\u2019s also elite at missing barrels and minimizing hard contact. There\u2019s some negative regression likely due, as he won\u2019t sustain his 4.5% HR/FB rate going forward, but he\u2019s been one of the best at limiting hard contact and barrels for a while now. He\u2019s be a great fit.", "date": "20231120", "sentiment": 0.998}, {"ranking": 0.3620689655172414, "comments": "Would you rather get Cody Bellinger or Jung-hoo Lee?

Also won 100 the next season.\n\n7. 2014 Nationals - Young, great regular season team with stellar pitching but inconsistent hitting.

The Sox\u2019 lease with ISFA expires after the 2029 season and I honestly think Jerry has at least 7 more years in him so where do you think they\u2019ll play?\n\nI think it\u2019ll be a travesty if he moves them from Bridgeport.  First and foremost, because they should stay on the Southside based on the tradition and there\u2019s value in staying in the neighborhood.  Secondly, because if a billionaire abandons GRate after using political friends to essentially extort taxpayers through ISFA\u2026he should be crucified.\n\nThat being said, Jerry loves money more than baseball and I think Soldier Field, Lakeside Center, and even the West Loop properties are potential goldmines.  I don\u2019t know if Soldier Field actually works,  but if they move there, I think the franchise valuation almost immediately doubled because there\u2019s a real chance to become the pre-eminent franchise in the 3rd largest media market.  At the very least, it becomes much more of a 1a/1b conversation.  I\u2019ve talked with a couple people that think the McCormick Place is a realistic option and that\u2019s likely a gold mine too.  The property boundaries are a little tight but they could make it work if they got creative with right field overlooking the Lake.  I don\u2019t think the West Loop option near the UC is quite as desirable  but you know Jerry would love to be co-located and get some economies of scale with offices, parking, staff, etc to\u2026make more money.  Stadium Sports Network which Jerry has controlling interest in is also headquartered at the UC and I think he\u2019s going to make a real push once the NBCSN contract expires next year to move the Sox, Bulls, and try for the Blackhawks to move there for Regional coverage.  \n\nI don\u2019t think the suburbs are a terribly realistic option but, obviously, there\u2019s some leverage to exploit there, especially if the Bears keep wavering and/or end up not using Arlington.  I\u2019m very confident Jerry will do the same thing as the Bears and try and leverage other suburbs line Naperville to essentially create a bidding war.  Nashville, IMO, is not a realistic option.  I know Jerry has a lot of influence with MLB owners but I really don\u2019t see them allowing him to re-locate from this market to the 26th largest in the US.  A second team in Chicago is way better for the bottom line than the only team in Nashville.  I also don\u2019t think JR would do it because\u2026he\u2019s a smart individual, he knows he\u2019s 87 years old, 93/94 when the lease expires, and a move to Nashville decreases the teams valuation if they decide to sell once he passes.\n\nTLDR:  I hope they stay in Bridgeport but I bet they end up in the West Loop or Lakeside.", "date": "20231116", "sentiment": 0.9852}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "Jason Benetti cites passion for analytics as factor in move to Detroit ", "date": "20231115", "sentiment": 0.4588}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "If any Sox player from history could have their best season for the 2024 Sox, what team would perform best?

I don\u2019t have the statistics. I haven\u2019t done the research. If I had to assume, which is what we\u2019re all left to do, it must have something to do with some combination of familial loyalty, local loyalty, and/or some indescribable quality of choosing a team during a vulnerable time in your life when you chose to be a fan of said team.\n\nFor me, I had my first major league experience in person during a 1996 White Sox home game. I was not born in the city. I was, however, born in the state. I came from a small town, and our little league team was treated to a major league game at the end of the year. In a predictable situation for anyone who knows the Chicago teams, our small-town league could not afford Cubs tickets for all of our hopeful, 9-year-old, soon-to-be major leaguers (or so we all thought). \n\nSo, we all ended up on the South Side. Within two innings we were treated to a Frank Thomas homerun a mere row before our row of future Sox outfielders. I was hooked. Unfortunately, from that moment on I couldn\u2019t not be a Chicago White Sox fan.\n\nCut to 20-odd years later, and I\u2019m still here. So, I ask again, why be a fan? I don\u2019t know\u2026\n\nMost of the questions I ask myself in life that feel vaguely existential I come to the same non-answer. I do not know. If I did then none of us would be here.\n\nBut I can answer unequivocally what I am. I am a Chicago White Sox fan. That has mostly led to pain. Particularly lately. \n\n\u201cFuck Jerry! Sell the team! Everything is doom and gloom! I\u2019m leaving to become a Cubs fan! I\u2019ve had enough!\n\nI see these statements frequently. More frequently than I see statements cheering on our team. I see similar statements with my other Chicago fandom team, the Bears.\n\nI get it. We\u2019re fanatical. It is tough sledding. It often seems like nothing is left to cheer for. Or, worse, if you cheer for the same team you\u2019ve been a life-long fan of somehow that indicates not just that you\u2019re a na\u00efve fan but somehow an enemy of true fandom. As if hoping your team succeeds is somehow antithetical to cheering for said team? That\u2019s enough to spin my head into a convoluted mess. I don\u2019t know about you.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s next for my favorite team. I have my opinions on what I want, but that to me seems rather silly. I already have MLB The Show. Trust me, I\u2019ve got us to the World Series. Oddly enough, my virtual expertise doesn\u2019t fulfill that hole.\n\nAll I know is that I\u2019ve proved myself two things:\n\n(1) I cannot make the changes I want to see, nor do I have any real experience that what I want would work\n\n(2) I want my team to win; that is every day, whatever the future may hold because that f-word is never promised\n\nSo, if I incorporate these two truths into my fanaticism, I\u2019m left with one inclusive option. I will watch next year. I will cheer next year. I will want my favorite team to win every single day next year. Sure, I will have opinions on how best to manage the team for future success. But I will hold this truth self-evident, that I have zero control. So, either I bail on the only team I\u2019ve ever loved (I won\u2019t), I will bail on the sport I love more than any (I won\u2019t), or I will put up with whatever is in front of me and cheer on my team same as every other fandom who has put up with shitty eras and shitty owners because that\u2019s what I\u2019m left with.

Caray  had been with the Sox since 1971 and had developed a tremendous  following. In many desolate years, Caray was the only reason to pay any  attention to the Sox. His style was aggressive. He wasn\u2019t afraid to pan  the players, or for that matter rip the owners. Caray wasn\u2019t a saint by  any means, with a tremendous ego, and he could be spiteful towards those  he didn\u2019t care for, like fellow announcer and former Sox catcher J.C.  Martin, whom Caray felt had no business being in a television booth.  But, to Sox fans,\u00a0Caray\u00a0was the best asset the team had.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;When  Einhorn and his partner Jerry Reinsdorf took over the White Sox, Caray  became intolerable to them. Einhorn is quoted in Logan\u2019s book as saying,  \"We were a freak show. The fans thought Harry and Jimmy (Piersall) were  the stars. Things were insane.\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Caray for his part, kept his  personal feelings about the new owners and his relationship with them to  himself, until the ties were severed between them. Afterwards he made  no bones about how he felt, saying in his autobiography that White Sox  fans would ask him why he left and why he went to the Cubs. Caray said  he loved Sox fans and Comiskey Park but he couldn\u2019t stand the owners,  going so far as to call them an unflattering name in the book and saying  they knew nothing about running a team.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231110", "sentiment": -0.0745}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "Broadcaster Jason Benetti explains decision to become television voice of Detroit Tigers ", "date": "20231109", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "I'm out ", "date": "20231109", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "\"Dad, how great was Jason Benetti as a White Sox broadcaster?\" ", "date": "20231109", "sentiment": 0.6249}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "[White Sox] Congratulations, Luis Robert Jr., on your first career Silver Slugger Award!

I don't know what my first game was, but one of my earliest memories is going to the last game at Old Comiskey We sat in the upper deck and left field, and my dad pointed out that the left- and centerfielders were father and son. \n\nMy wife and I had our first son the February before the 2022 season. By chance, his first game was in Anaheim to see the Angels where he saw Mike Trout hit two home runs. His first White Sox game was the following week, against the Angels, where he saw Trout hit another home run. He won't remember this, but I will be able to tell him when he gets older.\n\nMy White Sox fandom has been hanging by a thread for years. To not belabor the point, Mr. Reinsdorf doesn't run the organization in a manner consistent with being in one of the largest markets in the country. It has been painful to watch the White Sox become a national joke.\n\nJason was one of the few bright spots. No matter how bad the team has been over the last ten years, I could still enjoy putting on a game to hear him and Steve Stone on the broadcast. I do not believe it's hyperbole to say that Jason is on a track to become the Vin Scully of his generation. \n\nAnd the White Sox just let him go. Because he wanted to negotiate with an agent. Because the organization didn't want to accommodate his national duties. Because they didn't want to pay for premium talent (just like with the players on the field).\n\nI hoped Jason would be the voice of the White Sox for as long as he was willing and able. I hoped to build a connection with my son to baseball and the White Sox with him as a conduit. And the White Sox, in their race to alienate as much of the fanbase as possible, took that away.\n\nThanks,\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbatsugame13", "date": "20231109", "sentiment": 0.9677}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "Any remaining team spirit leaving my body now that Benetti is gone Will the pain ever stop", "date": "20231109", "sentiment": -0.5859}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "Why would anyone want to be a fan of this team?

Jerry realistically has 1-10 years before Satan takes him below. The team will likely be sold when he passes because his children will receive a valuation based on Date of Death not what he bought it for so it makes no sense to sell now as well as the cash flow is very poor to hold on to the team. This is why most teams are sold when an owner without a living spouse dies (Lakers are the only recent one I can think of that we\u2019re not).A new owner would require Chicago to throw a ton of money into a new stadium and this  would never pass through a vote. A suburb will attempt to make some offers but a city like Nashville will ultimately come through with the best offer and the team will move. Once this happens (and it will) are you going to continue to Support the Nashville, San Antonio, Austin, Mexico City Sox?  I personally will likely give up a fandom of baseball.", "date": "20231111", "sentiment": 0.8952}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "Benetti to the Tigers Pain", "date": "20231109", "sentiment": -0.5106}, {"ranking": 0.29310344827586204, "comments": "Please not Gordon Knowing this organization they\u2019re gonna announce \u201cNew White Sox play-by-play announcer Gordon Beckham\u201d\u2026 \n\nI know NBC Sports Chicago follows this sub.
