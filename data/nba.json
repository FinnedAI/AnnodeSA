We haven't been spanked like the lakers have tonight. The big-4 clippers just lost to the nuggets WITHOUT jokic and murray, letting DEANDRE JORDAN SCORE 22. \n\nWe have only lost to playoff teams, and besides the minnesota loss without embiid, we have been in every game that we lost. The worst feeling game was the celtics loss, but we had them within 5 in under 3 minutes left, we were in that game for pretty much the entire time. Even the Celtics have gotten spanked by the magic, and lost to the hornets, worse losses than we have had this season. Bucks have lost bad by near 20 to mid teams in the hawks and raptors.\n\nAll of this is reflected in our net rating, which is now the highest in the league after tonight (8.8).  \n\nHUGE difference from the doc rivers years. Comparing to last year through the first 17 games, we had FOUR disgusting embarrassing losses by this point in the season, worse imo than any of the losses we've had this season so far. I felt like i was pulling hair out last season, but this season, even when they do lose (and we will lose games over an 82 game season), I haven't felt bad or truly negadelphian yet. \n\nAnd so, our losses are even more telling than our wins imo.

I think Bridges fits all of those qualities, plus when Maxey sits he can go off and keep things afloat.

We need either one of them on the court at all times if not the offense completely crumbles. There is no one who can consistently create their own shot too. When Gabe Vincent is back, we've got another ballhandler. He is no point god but at least that will take some playmaking duties off of Bron and DLO. \n\n\n2. **Perimeter Defense:** AD anchors the interior so that isnt a big concern. But our perimeter defense is horrible. Our backcourt cannot defend for shit, any elite guard can and will go off against us. With Vincent, Reddish and Vando back, we will have a much improved defense. I don't think this will be a problem for us soon. \n\n\n3. **Shooting:** DLO has always been streaky, Reaves isn't off to the best start this season, Prince started out hot but is now bricking everything, Gabe was utter shit.  LeBron is surprisingly our best and most consistent shooter. Reddish and Rui are decent shooters, hopefully they will stay decent or get better. I think Reaves will get his shot back, he already has hit a couple clutch 3s for us this season. I have faith that it's just a cold streak for our guys, we don't have to be the 2016 Warriors, just shoot at league average and we are good. \n\n\n\n4. **Rebounding:** This is definitely the most frustrating one for me. We have size, but we just can't get rebounds. Rebounding is 75% effort, our guys just don't bother to. That's opportunities for 2nd chance points gone. I love LeBron but dude had 0 rebounds the other day, please don't do that again my king. With Vando back, it'll definitely improve but everyone needs to hustle.\n\n\n\nI think we are better than we seem, but not as good as many of us think we are. I have faith in the FO to make some moves but Lavine or Derozan is not what we need. They don't fix any of our problems.

I keep hearing the same thing every single time it comes to criticism of the Lakers coaching staff, specifically Darvin Ham: \u201cHe\u2019s an NBA head coach, he obviously knows best\u201d.\n\nIn general, I absolutely agree. There is not a chance in hell I or anyone here is more knowledgeable about the game than these guys, not even close. With that said, however, this doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s impossible for viewers to pick up on mistakes that they do make. Furthermore, it does not mean that some of these mistakes aren\u2019t very, very simple things that the coaching staff is just straight up not doing right, plain and simple.\n\nLast game was a perfect example of this. Both Darius and Pete from the LFR podcast, as well as Sean Davis from the Lakers Nation podcast, tore the coaching staff to shreds for this performance. All 3 of these guys are very, very good analysts, especially with regards to scheme and the strengths and weaknesses of various defensive coverages. All 3 of them considered this game the worst gameplan of the season bar none, and for good reason.\n\nSean Davis in the Lakers Nation post-post-game show went over this in detail. He pointed out 3 games in particular as examples of what the different defensive coverages will do against Philly, particularly with regards to doubling Embiid in the post. Letting Embiid play 1 on 1 in the post is a bad idea no matter who you have guarding him (except Al Horford for some reason), and especially if his primary defender is someone you can\u2019t afford to get in foul trouble, so the only question here is where do you double from?\n\n**Case 1: Brooklyn Nets.**\n\nThe Nets chose to double from the passer, and they got absolutely eviscerated. Embiid finished with 9 assists and 1 turnover, while Maxey and Melton (their two main ballhandlers), combined for 10/17 from 3, and the starting 5 went 12/24 from 3 overall.\n\n**Case 2: OKC Thunder.**\n\nThe Thunder chose to double from the baseline, and though they lost, this strategy did prove somewhat effective. Embiid still got 9 assists, but they forced 4 turnovers, and Maxey and Melton combined this time for 6/17 from 3, and the starting 5 as a whole ended 10/32 from 3. They still made some tough shots, but if you watched the game it was clear that Philly was working hard for their points.\n\n**Case 3: Cleveland Cavaliers**\n\nLike the Thunder, the Cavaliers decided to double from the baseline. This resulted in Embiid finishing with 5 assists to 6 turnovers, and Maxey and Melton combined for 4/18 from 3, and the starting 5 was 9/30.\n\nThis is a small sample size, but both the stats and, more importantly, the eye test back up the notion that doubling from the passer is not effective and only plays to Embiid\u2019s strengths as a passer, while doubling from the baseline forced turnovers and tougher 3s. The plan is clear, if you double, do it from the baseline and **not the passer!**\n\nCan you guess what we did? We doubled from the passer. What happened? Embiid finished with 11 assists and 3 turnovers, Maxey and Melton shot 8/18 from 3, and the starting 5 overall went 12/28 from 3. Who would\u2019ve thought?\n\nThis leads me to the crux of my point: Darvin Ham and the coaching staff made an error that even casual viewers could clearly see would be a mistake well in advance. Now okay, that\u2019s one thing for it to happen once in a regular season game, but the fact is this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen an error like this.\n\nIn game 2 against Golden State last year, we made the absolutely inexplicable decision to hedge/double Curry ball screens, specifically those involving Draymond. It\u2019s been known for as long as the Warriors have been a top team that hedging Curry ball screens is bad because it frees up Draymond as a short-roll passer where he\u2019s one of the best in the league. Now, with that said, *some* teams do have the personnel to do this somewhat effectively, but we were not one of those teams.\n\nThe obvious choice for us was to simply top-lock the screen, or in other words put pressure between the ball handler and the approaching screen in order to force them away from it. This can open up a driving lane, however with AD in a semi-high drop, he\u2019s still well within reach of recovery to assist the primary defender (though with Dennis\u2019 quickness this actually wasn\u2019t needed all too often, and AD served more as a helper on off screen cutters). This is not possible if AD hedges, as he\u2019s pulled deep beyond the 3 point line, and being our only consistently great defender on power plays like the 4 on 3 created here, we give up an easy layup most of the time. The worst part about this is that not only did we run this and get destroyed in the first half, but we didn\u2019t adjust at halftime. We did eventually switch to top-locking and even occasional switching later in the series, but to make such an obvious mistake even once is unacceptable in such a high stakes game.\n\nThe other major error we saw was game 1 against Denver where we, with absolutely no reasonable justification, ran small ball. Now if you want to make the argument that Dennis could guard Murray better than DLo fine, in fact I actually agree and the eventual decision to swap their places in the rotation was a smart one, even if it was far too late when it happened. The issue is that by starting DLo, Austin, **and** Dennis, that means one of those 3 would have to guard MPJ because Bron had to be on Gordon and AD needed to guard Jokic. Even worse is that it provides more options for the Nuggets to switch hunt into mismatches, because any of those 3 guards getting switched onto Gordon or god forbid Jokic would lead to a nearly guaranteed bucket. The result? We went down by 20 in the first half.\n\nNow, once again, to make that mistake is bad enough, but not only was the mistake made, **we began the 2nd half with that same group.**\n\nThere\u2019s a consistent theme here. Why did we double from the passer on Embiid? Because that\u2019s what we like to run against other teams. Why did we go small against Denver? Because that lineup won us game 6 against Golden State. Why did we hedge on Curry? Because\u2026 okay I\u2019m just gonna be honest I genuinely have no clue, it wasn\u2019t even a coverage we ran much in the first place, so it\u2019s even more puzzling why we\u2019d use it there. \n\nRegardless, I think we can all see that the coaching staff is, above all else, stubborn as hell. We see it all the time in the \u201chot hand gets benched\u201d thing we see from him. He\u2019s not intentionally benching the hot hand, he\u2019s just sticking to rotations he drew up pregame when most coaches would adjust them based on the flow of the game. It makes sense too considering Ham came from Budenholzer\u2019s coaching staff, and Bud was known for being unbearably stubborn about his schemes (it\u2019s literally what got him fired).\n\nNow I\u2019d like to pose a few questions: \n\nIs it possible to win a championship under a coaching staff that will, in all likelihood, lose 1-2 games per series purely off of schematic mistakes they refuse to adjust? \n\nIs there any sign that Ham will or is improving in this regard?\n\nIs moving on from Ham an option as of now?

I\u2019d be willing to give Ham the season to see what we got.\n\nAs it stands we\u2019re almost at the quarter mark of the season (time flies right?). Lakers are 11-8, 7th in the West, 3 GB of 1st. They\u2019re also in the knockout stages of the in season tournament, after going undefeated in the Group Stage.\n\nThis team is hard to read on. Very inconsistent so far but a lot to be desired. Big issues so far involve rebounding, shooting, and perimeter defense. \n\nWe aren\u2019t fully healthy, so granted I do think when we\u2019re at full strength, it\u2019ll help with those deficiencies. But even then I think this team needs 1-2 pieces to fully contend. \n\nDarvin Ham is also hard to read on. He\u2019s frustrating in a lot of aspects, but consider what he\u2019s done so far. Lakers had a 47 million dollar liability that hampered the team, and when traded for spare parts, this team went 17-6 to close out the year. And made the WCF. And while we got swept, I wasn\u2019t expecting a one legged Bron and AD to carry against the Nuggets. Especially when we had Tristan Thompson on Jokic. So I\u2019m willing to be patient with him. But he has to improve on rotations, because so help me god if I see Rui get garbage time minutes when he gets back, I\u2019m gonna lose it.\n\nPelinka has won me over a bit after that trade deadline and this offseason. If I\u2019m being honest, in the Lebron led era, I feel like he\u2019s only missed when it came to the 2021 offseason. 2019 offseason he built us a championship core with key vet min guys. 2020 he traded DG for Schroder and tweaked the lineup, and it worked very well until injuries piled up. Even last years offseason was solid IMO. \n\nSo I do believe whatever holes we have, he can address at the deadline. Also hope that he can net us one of the two pieces that I believe we need. I\u2019ll take either a Myles Turner type or a Alex Caruso type. Idk who, and idk how, so that\u2019s why I\u2019m not GM. He is lmao.\n\nAll in all. Too early to tell.

Fit, chemistry, and depth all play a role. The Lakers have not once looked like the team they will become once our injured players return.\n\nHaving Cam, Vando, and Gabe back is going to give the Lakers an obscene number of point-of-attack defenders to throw at initiators. This actually matters a ton in the Lakers' case, because POA defenders are the best way to maximize AD's otherworldly defense. You can hound initiators and wings on the perimeter without a care in the world if they drive by you, because you have the world's best help defender back there. Literally our top 3 POA defenders on the wing are hurt right now.\n\nIn addition, our non-LeBron lineups are going to look way different with a lot more depth. For example, Taurean sniping off the bench for 20 minutes a game and checking bench wings is a WAY better use of him than starting and hoping he can guard starting caliber wings for 30 minutes a game.\n\nAlso, this team will become sooooo versatile once we are healthy. Need a possession at the end of a game where we need to switch absolutely everything? Cam, Vando, LeBron, AD, and Wood is insane length that wont get beat easily on the perimeter. Need to go small against a run-and-gun team? Lakers can go \"small\" and run with other small ball lineups while still being big enough to punish them on the glass.\n\nOh, and that's another thing we're missing. Attitude. Intensity. This is about Vando in particular, but definitely applies to the others too. You saw the difference between our defense before and after the trade deadline last year. The different personnel made a difference, but it was more than that. The team's entire attitude shifted after that mid-season deadline. Having hustle-all-day players like Vando and Gabe that do the dirty work absolutely rubs off on their teammates. And the Lakers have been beating themselves with unmotivated play just as often as they are getting beaten by their opponents. \n\n**To be clear, this is not me saying that there is absolutely nothing to worry about.

Work's been keeping me busy with the end of the year approaching. In what was a back and forth affair till the first half, the Wizards lost handily to the second seed in the East. Here are my 5 takeaways from the blowout loss to the Magic: \n\n1. There was a clear difference in energy between the Magic and Wizards. The Magic's young guys, bench, and players played with a tangible pep in their step. The Wizards did the opposite of that. The Magic were hyping themselves after every bucket, feeding off their home crowd, and played with a youthful dynamic energy that we haven't seen at all from the Wizards. That was a huge factor in this game, with the Magic feeding off of that and squashing the energy-less and grit-less team from DC. \n2. A season high for Deni, and it looked like he was going to notch a new career high, but an untimely wrist injury kept him out of the rest of the game. He was playing with a pop to his step. He got most of his points in transition and on cuts to the basket. He's finally realizing that he has 3-4 inches and 20-30 lbs on most people at his position and is using to his advantage. It's what Kuz has been doing forever. It's a welcome sight and will be key to Deni consistently putting up big numbers. He only took two triples and one fell, and I'm okay with that because he didn't force anything. He took the right shots whether it was from the three, at the rim, or in the paint. He had a couple nice pull up mid range shots too. He's still very raw and obviously the mid range shots are new this year, but I can start to see a three level scorer start to come to form. He's still VERY VERY raw, but more time out in the fire and experience can make him dangerous especially given his size, speed, and length. It's all about reps and consistency for the Wizaraeli. Let's see if he can knotch that career high tonight. \n3. Kuz and Poole did Jakuzzi things (IYKYK). Kuz has 23 points, 6 assists, and 3 rebounds. One of his worse games as of late given how stellar he's played. Especially disappointing in the rebounding section. The fact that we're calling a 23/6/3 a little underwhelming for Kuz shows how much he's grown and what the expectations are for the veteran Swingman out of Utah. Kuz definitely could've been more aggressive, but I felt like he scaled back a little when he started missing shots right at the rim. He had a couple of beautiful step throughs that took him right to the rim but he blew it at point blank range. Loved the move, but terrible finish. Finishing some of those bunnies would've easily gotten him to 30. Lot like Poole: million dollar move ten cent finish. Speaking of Poole, he had another average game to add to his resume for the season. It will be forgotten with time: 19 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals. He did a great job picking and choosing his spots and taking and making the right shots. I have to accredit him to playing a lot more contained. Now it's about taking that and applying to it a larger volume. It's all about growing pains, and I firmly believe Poole can be a good player in this league, but it's going to take developmental time. He's only 24 folks! \n4. Magic put on a SHOOTING CLINIC in Orlando. They shot 60/60/80. That was not a typo. They shot 60+% from three and canned 17 TRIPLES. Their wing stars (Wagner and Suggs) feasted on the Wizards' sorry ass interior defense. Cole Anthony also burned them in the paint. When we tried to overcompensate by clogging up the paint one of their shooters like Franz burned us. To show you how bad our interior defense was JOE INGLES cooked us on the interior. Man was putting up floaters, and ones, and tricky fallaway shots contested in the paint. It was frustrating and funny to see as a Wizards fan. The defense was so bad we let 38 year old Jingles cook us. Man we certainly are going to be in the history books this season (just not for the right reason). We need to be much better on those rotations and leaving people open. Too many people were open and uncontested. Shots need to be contested and at least an attempt has to be made at defense. \n5. Bilal and Kispy had decent games. Kispy had 13 points on 4-7 shooting. Key for Kispy will be to hold that sort of performance consistent as he scales up in volume. He hasn't been able to find success on large volume CONSISTENTLY this season. We know he can do it on small sample size, so it's about getting the experience to figure out how to do it over a 82 game season. Bilal had 7 points and 5 rebounds. A relatively quiet and underwhelming game for the Frenchman. Bilal has to be a tad more aggressive with the minutes he's getting. Would love to see Bilal have the mentality that Geno has. Geno is SO NOT afraid of putting up shots and commanding the offense. Would love Bilal to have that mentality especially in garbage time. If the 19 year old is hesitant to do so, the coaches need to push him to be aggressive and take more shots, because he's capable of converting on his shots and putting up numbers. He just needs to trust in himself. \n\nOverall, not a bad game. The Magic have been surprisingly good in the early days of the season and it's not hard to see why. They have a great coach, young athletic long wings who can shoot, and great energy. Hard to compete with that. They have so many great picks who have turned out at the minimum as role players on contenders between Anthony, Wagner, Fultz (who's injured btw), Suggs, WCJ (who's injured btw), and Paolo. It's a tough team to beat, but don't think they will make much noise in the playoffs this year. Will take this group 2-3 years of losing to be consistent contenders. See Celtics back in the mid 2010s when the Jays were just drafted. See y'all in an hour when we try to get it back in blood back in Magic City.

While Westbrook had enjoyed a nice season with us, it was clear that his efforts were fruitless and we moved off his contract, ushering in the new era... or so we thought, as we kept Bradley Beal.\n\n2 years later, Bradley Beal's trade value, while still solid, plummeted. We got an old Chris Paul, which we turned into a 32 million dollar Jordan Poole. Before, we could have likely gotten a top-5 pick and maybe more!

As of the early afternoon of 11/28, they give up the second most offensive rebounds on average \u2013 13.6, with opposing teams converting this into 16.1 2nd chance points per game (fourth most in the NBA). \n\n\nThe attention often turns to Daniel Gafford, the team\u2019s rim protector, to determine what is going on. When Gafford is on the floor, the team is giving up 0.33 offensive rebounds per minute \u2013 the most on a team by a large margin. For context, Jordan Poole, Kyle Kuzma and Corey Kispert average 0.29. Landry Shamet and Mike Muscala average a 0.23. \n\n\nGafford does have the weakness of overcommitting to protecting the rim. At times, this takes away his ability to reasonably box-out because he falls out of position attempting the block. [An example is Clint Capela getting the tip-in because Gafford falls under the basket attempting to guard him down low](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=303&amp;GameID=0022300241&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Capela%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A3%20Def%3A1). Bilal Coulibaly could be noted for not appropriately fighting for the board.\n\n\nIt doesn't excuse the fact that Gafford does have poor rebounding IQ. Against the Nets, [he secures the position against but doesn\u2019t read the bounce appropriately](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=42&amp;GameID=0022300178&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Claxton%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A2%20Def%3A1)). Instead of keeping the box out, he stretches out for the rebound which allows the Nets to tip it back out. [Another instance of his poor reaction is Claxton punishing a lazy box-out to fight through for the offensive board](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=47&amp;GameID=0022300178&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Claxton%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A3%20Def%3A1).\n\n\n[It could be fatigue at some points \u2013 such as letting Capela slide in and secure the offensive board.](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=334&amp;GameID=0022300241&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Capela%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A6%20Def%3A1)) But then there are times where his team doesn\u2019t help him out. [The Wizards wings being slow to run in transition allows for a quick three point attempt where Gafford isn\u2019t in position to contest the board](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=83&amp;GameID=0022300178&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Bridges%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A2%20Def%3A3).\n\n\nThis is where it becomes difficult to blame him.\n\n\nThe Wizards hard commit to defensive rotations that often put him in a precarious position. [Gafford looks to close out on the three point attempt after Deni Avdija is slow to rotate and he\u2019ll lose the position for the offensive board](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=288&amp;GameID=0022300178&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Bridges%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A3%20Def%3A5)). The bigger issue is how Avdija follows his momentum out of bounds. He is no longer in a position to contest the offensive board or will have to hustle to re-join the court. \n\n\nThis trend is more apparent when Gafford is off the floor. Against the Hawks, [Kyle Kuzma rotates to close out the corner three attempt](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=211&amp;GameID=0022300241&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Bey%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A1%20Def%3A3)). He follows his momentum, which allows for Saddiq Bey to follow his shot and secure the offensive board. In another possession, [four Wizards collapse on the drive and the Hawks punish with by kicking out to the corner](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=264&amp;GameID=0022300241&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Bey%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A2%20Def%3A3)). Corey Kispert rushes to defend a potential swing pass, only to lose the ability to box-out Dejounte Murray. Kispert is a bad offender when it comes to this \u2013 [he\u2019ll often rotate out of position thinking it is to contest and then get beat for the board](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=545&amp;GameID=0022300049&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Beasley%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A3%20Def%3A6)).\n\n\nThere are other bad actors when it comes to the rebounding on the Wizards. Bilal Coulibaly, as previously mentioned, does have his share of woes. [He\u2019ll sometimes get out-muscled for the board](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=465&amp;GameID=0022300241&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Mathews%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A1%20Def%3A0)). [Or he\u2019ll have poor reads](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=105&amp;GameID=0022300253&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Sasser%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A1%20Def%3A0)). And then there are the miscommunication rebounds \u2013 [typically between Kuzma and Avdija fighting for a board and losing control](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=11&amp;GameID=0022300049&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=G.%20Antetokounmpo%20REBOUND%20(Off%3A1%20Def%3A0)). \n\n\nThe point is, as much Daniel Gafford could do to improve his positioning to secure the defensive boards, the Washington Wizards as a whole do a fair amount to make his life more difficult. The heavy switching nature of the team requires a large amount of hustle and speed that is difficult to repeat on a possession-by-possession basis. Because the Wizards play such a high pace of basketball, fatigue to their lone, consistent big man is expected and the team doesn't necessarily do a ton to protect him. This also took place last season in a different manner, where Wizards defenders would let their match-up run through the paint, hoping that Gafford could clean-up their mess.\n\n\nThe Wizards haven't necessarily looked to fix this problem for understandable reasons. They're in the better half of the NBA when it comes to opponent 3P FG% and force the eighth most turnovers in the NBA. While giving up 124 points a night, their defensive style is meant to lead to better transition basketball and play into their high tempo game of choice. When it works, it is great. When it doesn't, it leads to Giannis Antetokounmpo making Daniel Gafford look silly.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": -0.996}, {"ranking": 0.13793103448275862, "comments": "BTS footage of PBJ, Rollins playing for Go-Go and Wiz in 24 hrs ", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.2023}, {"ranking": 0.13793103448275862, "comments": "Rebuild Timeline Watching the Wizards get knocked around night after night I mean I knew this was going to be a tough season but just want to know what to expect for the next few seasons.

In what was a slugfest between the residents of the Eastern Conference basement, the Wizards emerged on top (quite handily). Here are my 5 takeaways from last night's basement: \n\n1. This was a Kuz masterpiece. Another near triple double from Kuz with 32 points, 12 rebounds, and 8 assists. Kuz has consistently been getting near triple doubles the last couple of games and I'm all here for it. I've been asking for greater production in other areas besides scoring, and Kuz has stepped right up to the occasion and has exceeded even my wildest expectations. I really think this can be a 25/10 season for Kuz, but now Kuz has to work on what has always been an issue for him: consistency. He has always been capable of doing this but the issue is too often he'll go back to playing like he did against the Hawks. Consistency is the name of the game for Kuz. At this point he has nothing left to prove as far as his skillset. Everyone knows he has all the talent in the world, its up to him to show out every time he steps out on the floor, especially since he is the de facto number 1 option on this team. \n2. All our starters got into double figures this game. It was a great showing of our depth (which has been lackluster most of this season). Tyus and Gafford had a pretty average game though Gaff did have 4 blocks which was great to see. Poole was the most surprising for me. He was 5-9 and has 12 points, and the surprising part for me was that he ONLY took 9 shots. He's playing super contained and not trying to do too much, and it might not always lead to him putting up big numbers, but that's what's going to help him achieve his goal of becoming a star long term. Deni was the second best starter with a 16/6/5 game for the Wizraeli. He got a lot of his points in transition and bullying his way to the rim. One big change I've noticed all season is his willingness to just run and muscle his way to the rim in transition. That's been huge and he's been converting at a high rate there. I'm pretty sure he also got his first career 4 point play (though I could be wrong) this game. It was a nice game for Deni. \n3. A nice game from the bench as well where we got 2 double digit scorers from there: Gallo and Shamet. Gallo hit three triples and a couple shots in the paint as well. Shamet hit a couple triples and hit some tough shots near the rim as usual. An underwhelming game for Kispy (2 in a row now) where he didn't hit a single triple and got 7 points off of cuts and dives to the basket. It will be key for Kispert to figure out the consistency in his production. We know what he's capable of:  we saw that at the end of last year. It's a matter of trusting himself and hitting those shots. \n4. Don't get this twisted: we won this game because of how bad the Pistons are, not because of how good we are. The Pistons are SOOO bad. It's not even funny. It's honestly to the point where I kinda just feel bad for them. 8 top ten picks on their roster and this is the result. Don't know how that guy Troy Weaver still has his job. The Pistons missed so many open shots and layups and just everything in general. Any other team would have beat the shit out of us with the shots we were giving up. We only got away with it because we were playing another shit team. \n5. When we're blowing teams out, I really want more Bilal, Deni, and Kispert minutes. I get that Deni is a \"starter\" and Kispy is basically our \"sixth man\" but we really need those boys to get as many developmental minutes as possible. I want them taking as many shots and getting as many reps as possible, and it's little frustrating to see them get benched for the third stringers. Not saying the third stringers shouldn't get reps, but the aforementioned 3 players should be getting as close to 30 minutes as possible. I think we'll see more of that post trade deadline when Tyus, Gallo, Shamet, and JP (maybe) will be gone and a lot more minutes will open up. \n\nOverall, it was a good win, but not a pretty one. I really did enjoy Kuz going off though in the third. It looked like he would have another bum game back in his hometown, but he quickly shut up all his dissenters with his stellar play in the 3rd. Kuz and our young guys are the only thing that bring me joy now. Watching Kuz kill it and make an ill-advised All Star Campaign and the young guys develop every game is what I look for now. I know people want to trade Kuz, but unless a can't resist offer comes around, I really would like him to stick around and be a mentor for the young guys. He's a great mentor who has the experience to do what it takes to get to the top, and he's a high character guy. You'd be surprised how hard it is to find those sort of people these days.

Holiday season kept me busy. The Wizards kept it close and made it come down to the wire in their last In Season Tournament Game of the season, but were ultimately outmuscled by the Bucks. A good game from the good guys, where we ultimately achieved the desirable end result which was a competitive loss. Here are my 5 points from Friday's game: \n\n1. The JP resurgence tour continues. JP had 26 points, 7 assists and 5 rebounds on 9-20 shooting from the field. All things considered this was a good game from him, and one where he showed a lot of improvement. In the last couple of games we've seen JP start to put it all together, and a lot of it is simple things: play contained (stop the flashy shit), pick and choose your spots when shooting, and play like you care. He's done all 3 of those things, and in the last couple games the results speak for themselves. \n2. Tyus would if he could play all 82 games against the Bucks. Tyus loves playing against MKE evidently. He had a season high 22 points and 7 rebounds and 7 assists. For Tyus, because of the way the Bucks pack the paint on defense, it leaves a soft spot in the mid to high paint area that is the optimal place for his floaters. The float king feasted because of the Bucks lackluster defense in that area. He also did a great job contributing as a playmaker and rebounder and making his impact multi-dimensional. Hope Tyus can keep balling out so we can get that sweet sweet draft compensation. \n3. Our sharpshooters were on one. Kispy had 20 points and canned 6 triples and Shamet had 15 points. Also, Shamet always has like on sneaky but crazy athletic impressive dunk seemingly every game it seems. I know I've been critical of Kispy, but it's because I know what he's capable of. Hope to see this sort of play from him lot more going forward. Shamet is coming along nicely, and will be a person who at the very least will next us a couple SRPs at the deadline. If he can consistently put up 12-15 ppg on 40% shooting from three maybe even a late FRP. We'll see. They did a great job making the Bucks pay for leaving them open, which was part of the reason we were in the game for as long as we were. Don't know what it was that the Bucks did or the Wiz did but there were WIDE OPEN shots all day long, even on the game tying attempt by Shamet which he missed, but shooters had a great game today in terms of the shots they took. \n4. Wiz actually played a great game. Almost a 50/40/90 game. HOWEVER, our swiss cheese interior defense made it difficult for us to hold on to a lead. Giannis and Lopez feasted on the interior, and whenever we tried to shore up on the interior they cooked us from the exterior (not Giannis but the Bucks as a whole). We helped the Bucks make franchise history by having it be the first game where 3 bucks players scored 30 points each. Feel like we're going to help a lot of teams set such records. Defense is the name of the game. Nowadays in the NBA, ANYBODY can score. It's about who can defend. Defense wins championships, and as long as there isn't Defense, this team isn't going anywhere. \n5. Wizards did an exceptional job minimizing TOs. They only had 8 TOs which is pretty low compared to what the Wiz have had in other games this season. The Wizards have had the tendency to have a lot of sloppy and stupid TOs. What you expect from a young rebuilding team, but that is not what happened tonight. We played disciplined and made the right passes, and played like a competitive team tonight. Hope to see more contained and disciplined play like tonight. \n\nOverall, a very impressive game from a massively outmatched Wizards team. Let's see if they can do something against ATL back at home (hint: they won't). \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": 0.9993}, {"ranking": 0.13793103448275862, "comments": "GAME 16 TAKEAWAYS: THE WASHINGTON WIZARDS (2-14) LOSE TO THE ATLANTA HAWKS (8-7) I was actually at this game, and quickly realized this wasn't going to be a fun game to watch irl. Here are my 5 takeaways from the blowout in the district on Saturday: \n\n1. We were very winded from the game against the Bucks. This was very apparent in the sloppy play. There were a lot of stupid TOs. There were a lot of sloppy passes. A lot of mistimed unforced TOs. A lot of airballs as well. Lot of shots were way off even from our sharpshooters. It seemed like a team that was running on like 5 hours of sleep, and that probably was the truth. Can't blame them for being tired after going down to the wire against a contender the night before, but that was undoubtedly the main culprit in the demise of the Wiz in this game. \n2. The Hawks got every shot they wanted, and not only got the shots they wanted but made them too. The Wiz on the second night of a back to back, played basically no defense. The Hawks got everything they wanted and there was little resistance. The Hawks were hitting some crazy shots later on too, at which point you kind of just had to laugh and say \"it's not our day.\" Some crazy fadeaways from Bogey and Trae and DeAndre. We were terminally cooked. \n3. Nobody on the Wiz scored more than 13 points. Take a guess who led the team in scoring. It was Jared Butler. A true who he play for sorta guy. Butler was nice to his credit, but he got all his points in garbage time. WUJ waived the white flag unusually early in this one as the starters sat the entire 4th quarter and 3 min of the 3rd as well. This gave all of our deep bench and third stringers a lot of useful playtime and developmental time. Bilal was the one who got the lion's share of the minutes. I would've loved to see Kispert and Deni out there, but by the time the third quarter ended, Kispert was already 1-10 from three, and Deni was 3-8. It wasn't their best games by any measure and I don't blame WUJ to keep them out to prevent it from being a bad game to their worst games (particularly for Kispert). Even Kuz never got it going, which was surprising to see, because the Hawks don't really have anyone to guard him. It just seemed like he didn't have the juice to take over and be the \"guy\" that he usually is and has been up to this point. \n4. Gaff was cooking early on, but for some inexplicable reason we took him out early and did not go back to him. It didn't really make sense to me, because in the first half, it seemed like the Hawks had no answer for the guy. He only played 18 minutes which was nonsensical to me. I don't know what WUJ has against the guy, but a common trend this season has been the lack of Gaff play. I get it \"he's not conditioned or primed to play 35 minutes\", but 18 ? Really? You can't convince me he shouldn't at least command 25 minutes a night. Very questionable decision making as has been all season from WUJ and Co. \n5. In his return from injury, Bilal looked decently nice. He didn't quite get into double figures but 7 points on 3-5 shooting in 31 minutes isn't TOO bad. He had a BLK and STL as well for his efforts, and was very good on the defensive end. I was impressed at how calm the kid looked in real life, and how collected and methodical all his movements looked. I really want to see him get 8-10 shots a game as the season progresses, and hope to see him put up 10-12 ppg, because he has all the tools to do it. It's just a matter of giving him the ball and the opportunity to grow and score. \n\nOverall, a true blowout, but not disappointing considering the circumstances. You know what they say though,\"there is no rest for the weary.\" We'll have to see how the Wiz cope with these B2Bs.

I\u2019m disappointed in the lack of creation on ball, it\u2019s surprising after watching him with the Warriors how hard he has to work to score with off balance or different kind of release shots. I see the three point percentage eventually rising but if he\u2019s more off ball because he can\u2019t be relied upon as a lead guard, that\u2019s not an efficient player if he shoots 3s in the low/mid 30s.\n\nIt\u2019s wild how infrequently Ayton gets to the free throw line and it seems he is not going to develop as a passer or three point shooter any time soon. But, one year less on the contract, great rebounder, at least an average defender. \n\nI think I\u2019ve flipped to thinking that Ayton would\u2019ve been a better acquisition than Poole.

The good guys held a 20 point lead, but just couldn't get the job done. Here are 5 points from the last game: \n\n1. Another great outing from Kuz. He had a near trouble. Kuz finished with 28 points, 10 assists, and 9 rebounds. As of late, Kuz has done a fantastic job dishing the ball to his teammates (and his teammates are doing their job hitting their shots of course). I'm loving the consistency and growth I'm seeing from Kuz. I love the consistency in the scoring, and the growth in the other areas of his game besides scoring. We have another about 40 games for him to keep balling out and raise his value, and then we'll be able to cash him in at the trade deadline. He played an efficient ball game: 12-22 and 3-6 from the field. Really nothing to complain about for Kuz except that he should've been the go to guy in the clutch. We've had this tendency to ice out the hot hand (which usually is Kuz) which is nonsencial, but good for the tank I guess. Would love to see Kuz try to take over games in the clutch. Anyways, hope to see this sort of consistency from Kuz going forward as he is our true number 1. \n2. Monster game from Gaff. He wasn't bullied like last time when Mark Williams basically ate him alive. 15 points and 16 boards for big Gaff. Pretty sure those 16 boards are a career high from him. I'm starting to see a little bit of Gaff with the scoring. It seems like there's a big emphasis on getting him the ball early on, and I love that. We have a unique aerial weapon, and I've pleaded for 2.5 seasons for them to use it, and it looks like it's finally being used properly. Better later than never I guess. Now it's on Gaff to convert at a high rate, and it looks like for the most part he's doing that. Would be amazing if Gaff could become a 15-10 guy for us. He easily has the potential to do that for us with his current skillset. For him, it's all about the mindset and staying aggressive, and staying cautious to not draw stupid ticky tacky fouls. He did that tonight, let's hope tonight is the beginning of a trend for the big man. \n3. This was a game where the starters did great, and the bench didn't. JP had 24, Tyus had 13, and Deni had 13 as well. They got what they were supposed to. The bench didn't help at all as not a single player was able to get into double figures. In games in the past, that figure has been Bilal, but Bilal got injured towards the latter half of the game, and he wasn't able to be that guy. Kispy had WIDE OPEN shots but wasn't able to knock them down. Those games happen for shooters, now it's about bouncing back. Feels to me like Kispy is still unable to find his true rhythm from deep. He's putting up a point less than last year on much worse efficiency. Hopefully he finds his stroke sooner rather than later. Bench is going to have do better than they did for the team to have a chance on a nightly basis. Starters did what they could. It's up to the young guys and vets to step up. \n4. This was a masterclass on how to blow a game again. It wasn't quite as infuriating as the TOR game, but it was still a little frustrating. A 20 point lead was once again blown, and the blame is undoubtedly the lackluster defense of the Wizards. Miles and Melo were getting everything and anything they wanted. There was absolutely 0 resistance. None. Absolutely pathetic to call what that was defense. Again, I'm not asking them to win games. I'm asking them to try. They did a great job against the Bucks, and got outmuscled. That happens, especially since we're talent dry as a tanking team. I'm just asking for effort, and I just don't know why that's so unreasonable to expect. There isn't a reason for a mid season firing unless stuff takes a turn for the worst (which I don't know how it's possible to get worse than it is now), but after this season I would really like a new coach. Maybe someone like Budenholzer, Atkinson, Brown, or someone else with a proven track record to come in and instill positive values and the mentality of a winner into this sorry excuse of a franchise. \n5. Not a great game for the younguns as mentioned before. Bilal got injured, but thankfully, he's fine. Deni has an average game and did what he was supposed to. Kispert had a below average game. Nothing to write home about. JD is looking better as of late, but I just don't know that there's space on THIS team for him. We just seem really crowded at that 2 guard and 3 spot, and I don't know that he adds a dimension different enough to warrant time over Kispert, Poole, and Bilal. Tough luck for JD, but it is what it is. Maybe after the trade deadline he can get some run, but I wouldn't hold my breath. Not a great game for the Wiz youngsters. We'll see how they bounce back against a stacked Bucks team looming. \n\nSorry for the late write up again! Holiday season has kept me busy. Today I'll try to be a bit more prompt. Anyways, the tank must roll on, and it most definitely will as we will almost assuredly get spanked by the Bucks at Fiserv tonight in our last In Season Tournament game of the season. Cover the eyes of the young ones, because this is going to be a spanking for the ages. We will almost assuredly see PBJ, Omorouyi, and the other end of bench guys get run tonight.

Holiday season has kept me busy. Here are my 5 takeaways from our loss to MKE:\n\n1. Unsurprisingly, Giannis put up another historic statline on us. As of late, whenever we've played Giannis he has absolutely COOKED us. I think last season he put up a career high 55 points when we played the Bucks in MIL. This wasn't quite that bad but it wasn't that far off as the Greek Freak had 42 points,13 boards, and 8 assists for his troubles. It seemed like he was going half speed out there for most of the game. When I saw he had 40 points in the fourth, I was honestly shocked, because it didn't seem like he was cooking us that BAD, but guess he was. Not a single soul or combination of souls on this team that could guard that monster of a man. Gaff tried, Deni tried, and Kuz tried but they were too small and too weak for the Greek Freak. Post game, Giannis had EXTENSIVE praise for Bilal. It's a great sign for the youngster from France to command praise from multiple superstars and coaches in the league already. I'm sure this hit particularly close to Giannis given Bilal's close background to his of playing in Europe since he was a young kid and the similar frame and similar skillset. Anyhow, Giannis cooked your Wiz. \n2. This was actually a close game until like the last 8 minutes. It was true that the Bucks didn't seem like they were trying till the last 8 minutes, but the Wizards managed to keep it neck and neck till the Bucks kicked it into high gear. They even briefly took the lead about 5 minutes into the fourth courtesy of Kispy. This is the type of games that we love to see. The young guys fought as hard as they could, but they were just outclassed and outmuscled when it mattered in the clutch. These are the types of losses we want. The losses that saw our young guys be competitive and actually keep it fairly close. Not games where we blow 25 point leads. This is good tanking, this is the type of tanking that we want. \n3. Box score watchers are going to say JP had a good game. He didn't have a good game, he had an okay game and probably his best game of the season, but that isn't a high bar given how shitty his other games have been thus far. He shot average from the field, and shot average from three. It took him 26 shots to get 30 points. This was the type of JP we expected coming into the season, but it has taken him 13 games to get here. Now the fact of the matter is, if he does this every night and gets 30 points, that's okay. However, he has been unable to find that sort of consistency early on. As a matter of fact, one can say he has been anything but consistent in the early days of the season. He has been getting a lot of hate (and rightfully) for how shitty he's been playing. A lot of lackadaiscal and idgaf type of play from Poole. This is his first \"good\" game and it wasn't even good. Says a lot about the type of season he's had. He still has ample time to turn it around, but he needs to get his shit together. It all starts with the mindset and mental approach to the game, and something tells me he hasn't had that figured out. Anyhow, I hope to see some sort of consistency from JP going forward. \n4. Kuz had 22 points and a career high 13 assists. He did a great job finding people in transition this game and being selfless. There were two goals from me for Kuz this season: find consistency in scoring and find other ways to contribute besides scoring. He's sort of done the first one, and hasn't done the second one consistently. He snags rebounds some games, he assists some games, he defends well other games. Would like to see him consistently shine in another area besides just putting up 20+, which everyone knows he can do. With his frame, skillset, and experience he should easily be capable of putting up big numbers in rebounds and assists. Either way, decent game from Kuz. Shot 10-15, and the Wiz should've gone to him more with how effective he was scoring the rock. He did a great job attacking Giannis, and the Bucks' Wings. He was very effective against them, and should've kept attacking but decided to take a backseat for some reason. \n5. Shoutout to Tyus. He had what was probably his best game since joining the Wiz. 18 points for the former Grizzly. Tyus has what is probably the best floater in the league. That thing is so damn consistent and so smoooth. For Tyus, it's all about finding his stroke from deep, and once he does that, he's going to consistently be able to put up 15 ppg no doubt. I think if he can start to find consistency with his shot and average 15 ppg, he will be a great trade piece for us. Bilal did Bilal things. 12 points on 5-7 shooting for the teenager from France. I find it astonishing how this kid always finds a way to contribute on such limited touches. He was a pest on defense tonight as well and had 2 steals to show for his effort. Bilal's gotten to the point where every time he shoots a three I really expect it to go in. He's shooting a blistering 47% from three, so it's no surprise that I feel that way. I really want to see Bilal either get more shots from three, or start to get to the basket more. I've seen him go to the basket early on and he tries some fancy finish and he just misses. I want to see him experiment more around the rim and try to finish there. IF he can start scoring at a high level there as well, he's going to be a problem right off the bat. Not great game for Deni, but hey that happens. The year's all about consistency and hopefully that will come with time for Deni. Kispy had a solid game with 12 points, and found his groove cutting and getting to the rack even if his shot wasn't falling. \n\nThis was a good game from the Wiz. They put forth a solid effort but were out gunned. Let's see how they'll do against a familiar opponent: the Charlotte Hornets. The series is 1-1 so let's see if they will take the lead tonight.

Ok, so I really like Fultz.  I have been critical of his shooting and his overall fit.  I am now convinced of this.\n\nFultz is a great facilitator and a decent scorer.  He is creative, changes speed well and finishes at the rim really well.  However, with him, the offense tends to be:\n\n* Option 1: He makes a play for Paolo or Franz either by a drive and dish or a screen and an awesome pass.\n* Option 2: He takes it and drives to the rim.\n\nThere is a lot of effectiveness in Option 1.  However, it's not necessarily flexible and can lead to thing bogging down and just becoming a bit awkward.\n\nThe key to all of this awkwardness is Black.  I for one would never have dreamed that placing a guy who doesn't really shoot for a guy that absolutely can't shoot would be a good thing.  The cool thing about Black is he just has that facilitator mindset.  Scoring is never a consideration for him like it is for Fultz.\n\nNecessity is the mother of invention.  When Fultz is on the floor, he is the PG and general.  Without him, it opens up a lot of things.  You have plays where almost every guy in the starting lineup (save Goga) brings the ball up.  Suggs plays exceptionally well off-ball and since Black isn't looking for a shot, ball movement is almost a necessity.  Suggs is cutting and screening with wreckless abandon to make sure the defense is always guessing. He has also taken over both as a safety valve scorer and team leader.  Our overall team assist numbers are actually better this year!\n\nNow, I'm not really saying that this can't continue with Fultz on the floor.  What I am saying is that with Black playing it seems to have unlocked Suggs.  \n\nI would not be surprised if Fultz is the center of trade talks even more than WCJ.", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.9907}, {"ranking": 0.5862068965517241, "comments": "MCW Love ", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.6369}, {"ranking": 0.5862068965517241, "comments": "(VIDEO) Jalen Suggs, Backcourt Ballhawk: *EVERY* Loose Ball Dive, Pick-Six Steal, Clutch Hustle Play So Far in 2023-24 (from @BeyondTheRK / Twitter) ", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": -0.4767}, {"ranking": 0.5862068965517241, "comments": "Psyched!

Let's preface this by saying that it doesn't need to be a WCJ vs Goga vs Mo situation where you are only allowed to support one guy... they all offer different things. I'm genuinely curious what our C rotation will be like when fully healthy. \n\nI know it seems likely that WCJ will default back to the starting job with Goga/Mo splitting backup minutes, maybe situationally based on whether we need more defense or offense off the bench. I really think Goga has been a big part of ORL's success so far though, and I think he is just too effective to let fade back to into an inconsistent role. I feel like a big part of the reason that WCJ is viewed as a way more important piece is simply because he was a higher draft pick/we invested more trade assets to acquire him. He's also had a longer track record so I definitely see him as more reliable I suppose. That said, Goga and WCJ are both only 24... and Goga has shown us a LOT to like to start the season so far. If I'm being honest, I think Goga could have just as much potential if not more than WCJ. They both have a great feel for the game and are excellent passers from the 5. Wendell has more of a \"bag\" on offense, but it comes with a significantly higher usage rate. Goga keeps it simple on offense and we already have so many guys who need the ball in their hands. While WCJ is a better defender than his blk/stl rates might suggest, Goga is a significantly better rim protector and just overall has a larger impact on that end. Outside of Isaac and Suggs, he probably has the biggest impact on defense for us and has all the tools to become an elite defensive anchor that WCJ simply doesn't possess. The biggest advantage WCJ has over Goga right now is his shooting - but it's not saying a whole lot as he's still only offers mediocre spacing at best. WCJ has gotten enough opportunity and reps and it's unlikely at this point that he develops in a much better than average shooter. This is a bit speculative, but Goga has decent form/touch and I think he might actually have a better chance to develop an above average 3pt shooter.\n\nUltimately I feel like we're in a tough spot because I do feel WCJ is the more proven/reliable option at this point to get the starting nod. And Mo has been a staple of our bench mob with his energy and offensive output against other team's benches. Elite offensive output off the bench is arguably more valuable than elite defense off the bench. Mo is going to get his minutes and he deserves them too. I'm just worried that Goga will drop back into obscurity with some DNP-CDs and maybe 10-15 minutes here or there, and he's going to leave this summer and blossom on another team. I genuinely think he could be on a Jakob Poeltl-trajectory with the potential of developing as a 3pt shooter if given the minutes. WCJ is deserving of being a starting C, but he thrives with more usage and better catch-and-shoot players around him. I think Goga projects to have a higher ceiling next to offensive stars with his lower usage and better rim protection, and that's before the speculation of him developing into a better shooter than WCJ. \n\nAm I high or why isn't Goga being talked about a bit more? It seems like a lot of people are kinda just like \"he did a good job filling in while WCJ was hurt. thank you, next!\"... and I think that's a mistake and not fair to Goga. He did everything you could ask for when given the opportunity and he deserves for a team to commit to continue developing him. He's not one of those raw players who have \"potential\", but hurt you on the court with their mistakes - he already has a very positive impact on the court.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9957}, {"ranking": 0.5862068965517241, "comments": "Magic fans help please \ud83d\ude05 I\u2019m not a magics fan whatsoever, but everytime I watch my rockets play the magic in Orlando or see Orlando on league pass there is a big guy with an Asian woman courtside at EVERY game.

If we do NOT advance, we\u2019d play other teams that did not advance to make up a total of 82 games. \n\n-Advancing would mean, in theory, we\u2019re playing among the best teams so far this year. Failing to advance would mean, in theory, we\u2019re playing easier opponents compared to advancing.\n\n-Failing to advance, by my reasoning, would give us a greater chance at winning those 2 extra games. Think about a nightmare scenario where we advance, lose in the quarters, and then miss the playoffs (outright) or have to move to the play in tournament (instead of automatically qualifying) off that one game?\n\nAll of this is compounded by the fact, in my thought process, that winning the IST doesn\u2019t offer much of a reward. Notoriety and cold hard cash are far from nothing, but no draft pick considerations, no improvement to playoff positioning or home court considerations. \n\nAll that said\u2026 it would be \u201ccool\u201d to advance. But am I crazy to think it would be \u201cbetter\u201d (from a playoffs odds perspective) if we didn\u2019t?\n\nEDIT: I see that I am largely alone in this sentiment. I\u2019ll return to my regularly programmed, full out \u201cwin or die\u201d mentality. I appreciate everyones counsel in this time of need.

In the first eight games, those marks were 66.7 and 30 percent, respectively.\n\nHis overall shot volume and free-throw attempts remains mostly the same, but he\u2019s much deadlier in the paint than previous stretches. Zion looks a lot more like his second-year self, whose scoring average and efficiency remain unmatched by any other second-year player ever. He\u2019s not far off from last season\u2019s All-Star production before he got hurt.\n\n[New Orleans](https://theathletic.com/nba/team/pelicans/) went 6-1 amid Zion\u2019s hot seven-game stretch.

We\u2019re seeing great positives recently as:\n\n1) Zion and Ingram are playing much better\n2) Role players are showing competence\n3) Team is getting healthier\n4) We show in stretches (and some games) that we can battle with the best\n5) Herb Jones \ud83d\uded1 \n\nBut even so, I can\u2019t get over how we can battle elite teams regarding our front court. Even when CJ and TM3 get back, the problem still lingers. We\u2019re about to face off against Philly who are rolling with Joel playing great. Even if they\u2019re in the East so it\u2019s not as much of a concern, I don\u2019t see how we can overcome Western elite teams with good bigs (Lakers, Nuggets) as Zion, JV, Nance, etc do not match up well defensively. On the other hand, the elite teams who\u2019s bigs aren\u2019t as notably skilled still run circles around us with ball movement (Warriors, Kings) and our bigs often lose out in these rotations. The elite teams we fare fine against are iso-heavy teams where the center isn\u2019t as involved in making plays (Suns, Mavericks).\n\nNance is honestly too small against certain lineups. Zion and JV have narrow versatility on defense. Offensively, these two have spacing issues so the half court set needs to pick one or the other; this ultimately gives an advantage to the other team in the half court.\n\nObviously, this is the missing piece that mgmt needs to seek out externally (trade, free agency/drafting).

Alright, so let's pretend that we find ourselves fully healthy for the first time since the name change. We have so many talented pieces deserving of minutes... how do you think our coaching staff handles the plethora of talent? In my opinion, the Pelicans essentially have 11 guys that could start on many teams throughout the NBA. Just my no-basketball-coaching-experience opinion here, but here's how I'd handle it in immediate future:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Starters**: *Dyson - Herb - BI - Zion - Jonas*\n\nThis lineup screams defense and transition buckets, and it's working. Dyson has been a dog and learning much more quickly being surrounded by the starters. Herb is DPOY candidate, but it doesn't make a difference if the opposing team screens him with their worst player and we switch everything. Having another menace like Dyson out there allows creative defensive schemes as we saw against Dallas this past week. This also frees up BI and Zion to handle the majority of the scoring, which I think is important as Dyson and Herb don't need the ball in their hands to make an impact.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Second Line (in order of mins)**: *CJ - Trey - Hawkins - Jose - Naji - Nance*\n\nCJ and Trey deserve starter level minutes regardless of where they are in the lineup. It's hard to call CJ and Trey \"bench\" players with their level of impact, so I wouldn't be surprised to see either one of them in the starting lineup. I do think those two leading the bench would instantly make the Pelicans' second unit one of the best in the entire league. It also allows us to get creative on offense. Can you imagine a CJ-Trey-Hawkins-Zion lineup at some point? BUCKETS. Jose and Naji continuously prove they deserve minutes with their energy and effort, hopefully providing much needed breaks for our starters. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Deep Bench**: *Matt Ryan-Zeller-Robinson Earl*\n\nI've been impressed with all three of these players this season, and it's nice to have them in case of injuries or foul trouble. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhatever your view of the team is, when healthy, we have a deep roster that affords a lot of coaching creativity on both sides of the ball. We can expose a lot of teams' weaknesses utilizing our different lineups and array of talent.... **IF** we ever get fully healthy. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPels stacked.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231123", "sentiment": 0.9836}, {"ranking": 0.7241379310344828, "comments": "Zion gets clobbered by Sabonis in the head.

Jerome, sidelined for more than a month because of a severe right ankle sprain that has kept him from doing any substantial basketball-related activities, had a cast put on last week to immobilize his right ankle. A source said Jerome will need to be in the cast for about a week -- a new approach to finally get him back to full strength. If it works, he can then start individual workouts\u2026.\u201d\n\nWhile Jerome was originally expected to be veteran Ricky Rubio\u2019s understudy for one year, Rubio paused his career and stepped away from the team to focus on his mental health, which led to Jerome becoming the backup point guard coming out of training camp. He played five minutes in the team\u2019s season-opening win against Brooklyn on Oct. 25 before suffering the painful injury two nights later in the home opener.\u201d\n\nTLDR: progress on his injury recovery has stalled and he has not returned to basketball activities or practice. They changed his treatment plan to hopefully let him fully heal. Optimistic timeline is weeks- if all goes well this week he could possibly progress to workouts next week (probably not team workouts or practices but individual work most likely). \n\nSounds a little rough that he\u2019ll need to have his ankle immobilized, but also I wonder why this wasn\u2019t done in the first place if it has always been considered a \u201csevere\u201d ankle sprain. \n\nThoughts?", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.664}, {"ranking": 0.7586206896551724, "comments": "Craig porter jr is very decent (Thunder fan) dude could totally make an all rookie team if he gets the pt, he seems very very effective at getting to his spots on the court and driving to the basket.

On a personal note I bet the spread and lost and that stings. Leading by 16 in the second, and fourteen in the third, only to then allow the Blazers to go on a 55-29 run... that's  brutal, I'm not going to lie. The Cavs' seemingly had this game in the bag, and yet still managed to blow it to one of the 'worst' teams in the league.\n\nHowever, the Trail Blazers as of late aren't as bad as their perception would have you believe. Over their last four games, they have beaten the Jazz by 16, lost to the Bucks by 6 (after leading by 26 at one point), beaten the Thunder by 4, and now beaten the Cavs by 8. While at the time each loss (and the fact that the Bucks were ever down in the first place) was seen as horrific, what if the Trail Blazers have turned a new leaf, and are not as bad as previously thought? If the Cavs had fought hard against, but ultimately crumbled to the Magic, would this loss seem as bad?\n\nAdditionally, the Trail Blazers shot 14-35 from three tonight, for a crisp 40.0%, while the Cavs shot a measly 7-32, for an absolutely atrocious 21.9%. If you adjust both teams to their season averages from three (which I think is fair, since the Cavs both shot many open threes, and the Trail Blazers were defended similarly to how the Cavs have been defending all opponents on threes), it would change the final score to 108-96... Cavs win. If the Trail Blazers and Cavs both shot the three at their season averages, the Cavs' would have won by 12. Despite all the flaws in the game from the Cavs, missing threes is ultimately what doomed them.\n\nWith this in mind, the Cavs still have issues to address.

Before we start\u2026 yes JB has been an issue for a myriad of reasons and this doesn\u2019t takeaway from that. \n\nThat said, Darius Garland is the Cavs problem. \n\nAfter his All-Star appearance 2 seasons ago he\u2019s essentially plateaued and/or regressed as an offensive player.  This is primary driven by turnovers in which he is now firmly one of the leagues most turnover prone players.  Thru 13 games he has 54 turnovers at 4.1 per game which is contention for worst in the NBA.  Furthermore his TOV% of 20% is 4th worst in the the entire league, the worst of his career, and 4% higher than his career average. \n\nAdditionally, his assist %, offensive win shares, and defensive win shares are both the lowest they\u2019ve been since his rookie year.  \n\nMore, his VoRP (Value over replacement player) is a ZERO.  So, he\u2019s literally being paid a max contract for replacement level performance.  For comparison, Craig Porter Jr has a better VoRP at 0.2. \n\nCavs Win Shares / VoRP:\n1. Mitchell 1.6 / 1.0\n2. Evan Mobley 1.9 / 0.6\n3. Max Strus 1.3 / 0.5\n4. Jarrett Allen 1.5 / 0.4\n5. Craig Porter Jr 0.5 / 0.2\n6. Caris LeVert 0.6 / 0.1\n7. Tristan Thompson 0.3 / 0.1\n8. Darius Garland 0.5 / 0.0\n\nLastly, let\u2019s not even go into the defense where he\u2019s the worst rated rotation player by DBPM @ -1.4. \n\nUltimately, the finger can be pointed at JB but the guy is forced to play a ball dominant PG who frankly sucks both directions and is 19th in assists per game.  \n\nFrankly, I\u2019ve seen enough of DG and wish he would have been shipped in the Mitchell deal.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": -0.6369}, {"ranking": 0.7586206896551724, "comments": "No context Okoro ", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": -0.296}, {"ranking": 0.7586206896551724, "comments": "WE\u2019RE HERE MUCH QUICKER THIS TIME!

Unfortunately, the odds of the Cavs moving on are pretty slim, and they'll probably have to blow out the Hawks to even have a chance. Here's a look at the current standings in the East:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Team|Group|Point Differential|Point Diffential vs Cavs|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**IND (4-0)**|**A**|**Winner Group A**|**Winner Group A**|\n|**MIL (3-0)**|**B**|**+39**|**+33**|\n|**ORL (3-1)**|**C**|**+22**|**+16**|\n|**NYK (2-1)**|**B**|**+18**|**+12**|\n|MIA (2-1)|B|\\+11|\\+5|\n|BKN (2-1)|C|\\+8|\\+2|\n|CLE (2-1)|A|\\+6|0|\n|BOS (2-1)|C|0|\\-6|\n\nSo you can see that the Cavs are clearly at a disadvantage here. It would've been nice to get some better PD out of the Detroit game. Regardless, all 5 of tomorrow's Eastern Conference In-Season Tournament games will impact their odds, so I've decided to rank all 32 potential outcomes on how they affect the Cavs!\n\nFirst, here are the games:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|ATL @ CLE|MIL @ MIA|CHA @ NYK|TOR @ BKN|CHI @ BOS|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n\n\nThe tiebreakers first determine seeding in the group before determining the wildcard. First is head to head record (only in the group) then point differential, then total points scored, then season record. Cavs currently have a modest total points scored advantage over every team in contention except for Milwaukee (-25) and Orlando who has played all of their games (-100, meaning Cavs need to score 101 vs Hawks to own tiebreaker.) With that out of the way, let's get in to the first 16 outcomes!\n\n# Tier 0\n\n|ATL beats CLE|\n|:-|\n\n\nIf the Hawks win, the Cavs are eliminated. In the rare possibility that the Heat, Knicks, Nets, and Celtics all lose, Either the 76ers or the Hawks have a chance to take the wildcard, although they would need to overcome an imense amount of PD from every team in contention. This accounts for the first 16 outcomes.\n\n# Tier I: Win and In\n\n|Game|PD needed to overcome|\n|:-|:-|\n|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|\n|**CHA** @ NYK|N/A|\n|**TOR** @ BKN|N/A|\n|**CHI** @ BOS|N/A|\n\nThis is the only scenario in which the Cavs win and don't need to edge a team over point differential. Extremely unlikely, but we can dream.\n\n# Tier II: Win and Win Good\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Game|PD needed to overcome|Game|PD needed to overcome|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|\n|**CHA** @ NYK|N/A|**CHA** @ NYK|N/A|\n|**TOR** @ BKN|N/A|TOR @ **BKN**|2|\n|CHI @ **BOS**|\\-6|CHI @ **BOS**|\\-6|\n\nCavs have a nice 6 point cushion over Boston, but may need to outperform Brooklyn. Still these are not very likely outcomes.\n\n# Tier III: The Knicks\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Game|PD needed to overcome|Game|PD needed to overcome|Game|PD needed to overcome|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|\n|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|\n|**TOR** @ BKN|N/A|**TOR** @ BKN|N/A|TOR @ **BKN**|**+2**|\n|**CHI** @ BOS|N/A|CHI @ **BOS**|**-6**|CHI @ **BOS**|**-6**|\n|Game|PD needed to overcome|Game|PD needed to overcome|Game|PD needed to overcome|\n|MIL @ **MIA**|**+5**|MIL @ **MIA**|**+5**|MIL @ **MIA**|**+5**|\n|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|\n|**TOR** @ BKN|N/A|**TOR** @ BKN|N/A|TOR @ **BKN**|**+2**|\n|**CHI** @ BOS|N/A|CHI @ **BOS**|**-6**|CHI @ **BOS**|**-6**|\n\nIf the Knicks win, the Cavs have to at least beat their point differential, and there's no way around it. They are the team most likely to keep the Cavs out of the wildcard spot. If they win by a big margin they are likely out, and if the Hornets keep it close you still need to contend with all the other teams in the hunt. Even though this is an uphill battle, it's still fairly straightforward and not completely out of reach for Cavs if they play really well, But after this is where...\n\n# Tier IV: Things get wierd\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Game|PD needed to overcome|\n|:-|:-|\n|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|\n|**CHA** @ NYK|N/A|\n|TOR @ **BKN**|**Group C Winner**|\n|**CHI** @ BOS|N/A|\n|\\*Orlando Magic|**+16**|\n\nA Brooklyn win combined with a Celtics loss gives the Nets the group C win, regardless of PD. This means that the Cavs will have to overcome Orlando's +22 Point differential. Having already played their games, the Cavs don't need to worry about outperferforming them if this happens, they just need to win by 16 by scoring 101 (this is due to the aforementioned total points scored tiebraker,) or win by 17+ otherwise.\n\n# Tier V: Suffering\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Game|PD needed to overcome|Game|PD needed to overcome|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**MIL** @ MIA|N/A|MIL @ **MIA**|**+5**|\n|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|CHA @ **NYK**|**+12**|\n|TOR @ **BKN**|**Group C Winner**|TOR @ **BKN**|**Group C Winner**|\n|**CHI** @ BOS|N/A|**CHI** @ BOS|N/A|\n|\\*Orlando Magic|**+16**|\\*Orlando Magic|**+16**|\n\nBy this point it would take an absolute thrashing of Atlanta to get to the wildcard spot. Needing to outpoint Miami, Orlando, and New York almost certainly eliminates the Cavs from contention.

I want to start a new weekly statistical insights post that shares a few stats I find interesting that may be relevant to current discussions around the team. The goal of these posts would be to add some interesting and objective facts to encourage meaningful conversation around the team. With that said I wanted to start with an observation I found while watching the game last night:\n\n**Garland AST/TO**\n\n*Stat to Know:* **Garland averaging 4.3 TOs/game (2nd worst in league) and 1.28 AST/TO Ratio**\n\n*Why it Matters:* DG has had a bit of a sloppy start to the season, sitting behind only Cade Cunningham (of the abysmal Pistons) for turnovers/game. Some of the names that follow include extremely high usage players (Giannis, Durant, Luka Doncic, Trae Young) that DG controls much fewer possessions than. His AST/TO ratio at 1.28 also puts him in the bottom 10% among guards getting 20+ mpg in the league. However, this to me looks like an outlier on a smaller sample size, as this is a large deviation from last season, where he averaged 2.6 TOs/game and had more than twice the AST/TO ratio at 2.70. This is most likely driven by our inconsistent rotations to start the year, which brings me to my next stat...\n\n**Lineup Consistency**\n\n*Stat to Know:* **Cavs Highest MPG lineup (Garland, Mitchell, Strus, Mobley, Allen) has only played 66 minutes together this season, 29th in the league**\n\n*Why it Matters:* With our string of injuries early in the season, the Cavs trail only the Pelicans for the lowest total minutes on our most consistent 5 man lineup. The Cavs also have 20 different lineups that have played together &gt;10 minutes this season, which ranks 28th in the NBA behind only the Lakers and Heat. While some of this is likely due to experimentation with some of our new rotation pieces, a majority of this comes from our injury woes to start the year\n\n**Hot Start for CPJ**\n\n*Stat to Know:* **Porter Jr** **averaging 19.2 pts / 36 minutes, 3rd in league among rookies with &gt;10 GP**\n\n*Why it Matters:* CPJ has had a terrific start to the season, trailing only Chet and Wemby in Points/36 minutes among rookies with regular rotation minutes. With the latter two being phenom freaks and clear front runners from the start of the season for ROTY, CPJ has been by far the most surprising positive rookie contribution in the league. He is also 5th in the league in Ast/36 Min and in the top 10 for FG% among rookies. Still a small sample size with only 11 games played, but if CPJ can continue his hot start, we should look to give him a big minutes bump to help lead the second unit.\n\nComment with your thoughts below, and feel free to give me feedback on if you want to see more of these!

Slow down everyone!\n\nFirst off it\u2019s great to see Garland and Allen playing healthy.  I\u2019m glad everyone is reminded of how effective and clutch Allen is.  His game doesn\u2019t stuff the stat box, but he gets key rebounds, gets key dunks, and fights on every possession.  He\u2019s really valuable.\n\nTo the point of this post though, yesterday\u2019s game would have been a blow out with Donovan Mitchell.  The best thing about Donovan\u2019s game is he can just go get a damn bucket when everything slows down and defenses get really physical.  Darius Garland, who is a treasure of a player and everyone adores to watch him because he\u2019s so damn cool, struggles with this.  He kind of always has.  He gets beat up, he can\u2019t get the ball back with any space.  Last night we got bailed out by him shooting a really nice, ugly, Hail Mary 3 and the giant cajones of Craig Porter Jr.  Without those two plays we lose.  With Donovan Mitchell in that game, we have someone who\u2019s going to create space for a clutch 3 or get a clutch foul call and keep our scoring up.  Please stop looking for reasons to be against this guy who we\u2019ve given MVP chants for the last year.  He\u2019s a walking bucket, he\u2019s committed on defense, and he supports the team too.  Donovan Mitchell will be critical in playoff basketball for this reason too - playoff basketball is half court scoring, defense and the ability to go get a damn bucket when you need it.  Donovan Mitchell last year had the 37th highest effective FG%.  Doesn\u2019t sound amazing right?  The only guards with volume better than him were Steph, Halliburton and Kyrie.  Same goes for TS% - guards in his range are Steph, Halli, Kyrie, SGA and Lillard.  It\u2019s not as pretty to have a guy who just goes and gets efficient buckets but it\u2019s so valuable.  By the way, who got the game winning bucket in game 1?\n\nThese are great guys.  Great personalities, great players.  Let\u2019s celebrate that without tearing anyone down.  And criticize too in a healthy way - Evan Mobley can\u2019t be going 2/8 on post plays for example.  He\u2019s immediately stepped up that part of his game this season and his efficiency is going way up!  Awesome!\n\n I was at game 1 this year.  DM\u2019s favorite moment last year in the whole season in an interview was Isaac Okoro\u2019s game winning shot.  The guy scored 71 and that\u2019s his favorite moment.  He\u2019s with us (at least for now) and he\u2019s part of this team.  He\u2019s an important key player who arguably should have been 1st team all nba last year.\n\nWe have already had so many fun moments this year.  It is extremely impressive we\u2019re 8-6 with injuries alllll the time.  Let\u2019s be patient about that, let our guys come back healthy and supported.  It\u2019s looking like 1-10 on our roster are really solid.  We love Max Strus, Levert has been balling, Okoro has had great energy and we\u2019re so excited about Craig Porter Jr!  George Niang has started shooting better!\n\n Let\u2019s keep the energy high, keep the support high and LET EM KNOW.  We can easily be the best fans in the NBA.  Let\u2019s get this dub against the Heat tonight!", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9994}, {"ranking": 0.7586206896551724, "comments": "[Game Thread] Cleveland Cavaliers (8-6) vs. Miami Heat (9-5) [11/22/2023 07:30 PM EST] #Summary\r\n|Team|1Q|2Q|3Q|4Q|Total|\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n|**CLE**|26|29|24|17|96|\r\n|**MIA**|37|32|32|28|129|\r\n\r\n|Status|Game Clock|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|END Q4|00:00:00\r\n\r\n#Box Score\r\n|P|Name|PTS|REB|AST|+/-|FGM/A|FG%|2PM/A|2P%|3PM/A|3P%|FTM/A|FT%|DREB|OREB|STL|BLK|PF|TOV|MIN|\r\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\r\n|SF|**M.

How did we get here? I was thinking about what an excellent job Stone has done rebuilding the Rockets after TillMan Fertitta bought and destroyed the best squad in the league, and realized that many fans who are overly negative about how bad we looked during the tank might benefit from seeing just how adeptly he crafted a team capable of going toe-to-toe with the very best teams in the NBA in an amazingly short period of time.\n\nHopefully the squad can stop choking away close games and learn how to win on the road so that he can get the recognition he deserves as being Executive of the Year.\n\nThere have been a LOT of moves made around the periphery, bu for the purpose of this exercise, I will only mention players that had solid trade value, because the returns on those players were the building blocks of the team we have now, in addition to the Big-3 picks gained by making the controversial and painful decision to purposely tank to the very bottom of the league for each of the past 3 years. I will also ignore 2nd round picks (SRPs) completely, because I don't really value or care about them. Sue me. But please do know that *many* SRPs were both found and harmed in the process of this rebuild.\n\nFirst, let's remember who was on the squad at the end of the 2020 bubble season that marked the true death knell of the Harden Era Rockets and left us with multiple disgruntled superstars and 4 future picks (well, 2 picks and 2 swaps) in the hands of Sam Presti.\n\n**James Harden, Russell Westbrook, PJ Tucker, Robert Covington, Eric Gordon**\n\nHoly crap. That's really the complete list of ostensibly positive value assets that Stone was left with. Keep in mind that the first 3 of these guys were doing everything in their power to get away from Houston, taking away the tools of time and leverage that are most beneficial to a GM when looking for trades, so calling Russ and PJ \"positive value assets\" is wording it kindly.\n\nThe first move was a masterclass. Over a period of 2 days before the opening of Free Agency that ended up turning RoCo into Christian Wood, the Garuba pick, and a protected Detroit FRP that appears on track to become 2026 &amp; 2027 SRPs, but could potentially be as high as a late lottery pick in a couple years if Detroit can turn it around. We no longer have any of these assets, so one should rightfully question why I call it a masterclass. Well -- just trust me... It was incredible value at the time, and I believe you'll agree that what we used the Detroit pick on was a worthwhile investment. \n\nWith no picks in the draft that year, Stone still managed to add KJ Martin and Jae Sean Tate to the squad by buying a pick from Sacramento for a few million dollars. KJ is gone for SRPs (again, I don't care about these, but nice positive value turnaround for a few Million bucks deserves to be noted). Tate remains a valuable part of our core, though, after being scouted and plucked from down under.\n\nThe next move was getting rid of a malcontented Russel Westbrook. The return was not great. John Wall coming off injury (a truly negative value contract) and a heavily protected Washington FRP that will almost certainly convey as their 2026 SRP. Yes, just over a year after Fertitta openly bragged about getting Russell Westbrook for the amazing price of merely Houston's 2024 and 2026 FRPs (and swaps in 2021 and 2025)... not to mention the relief of shedding the worst contract TillMan had ever seen in CP3... we were able to flip our first superstar for what will likely end up being a 2026 SRP. Doesn't get much lower than that in terms of losing trades, but before you judge Stone too harshly, wait for the final tally.\n\nAfter a very brief dalliance in the Harden/Wood/Wall experience, James pouted his way out of town in a deal that changed the way superstars are dealt. Instead of seeking a potential up &amp; coming star, the value in the return came in the picks. 3 unprotected BKN FRPs along with 3 swaps. Not amazing by today's standards, but that is because it is the trade that truly created the market we see today. In hindsight it was a truly revolutionary move, betting on the eventual failure of the other franchise to reap the value instead of taking a star-in-the-making. There was a chance to get Jarrett Allen that some fans still bemoan, but trading him and our own SRP away brought back the FRP that eventually became Josh Christopher (in other words nothing of value) and a 2023 FRP from Milwaukee. So Harden and a SRP brought back 5 FRPs and 3 swaps. We'll check in on those in a minute.\n\nIt also set the team up to feature an offense centered around All-Star in the making Christian Wood, as the team chased the playoffs at Fertitta's behest. The WOW lineup rode the 2nd-best defense in the NBA (behind the Champion Lakers) to an above-.500 record when disaster struck (the blessing-in-disguise type) when Christian Wood went out with an ankle injury. Somehow, Wall, Oladipo, and 26 other guys (an NBA-record 30 in total) weren't able to find a win and after the All-Star Break, the tank was on to take a risky coin flip gamble that Houston could keep their own 2021 FRP instead of swapping with OKC's FRP from Miami in the late teens. \n\nYou know how that turned out. In the biggest win of the season (and arguably the entire 3-year rebuild), Houston retained the right to draft its own pick instead of sending pick 5 to OKC as the first pick of the Westbrook disaster. TillMan was visibly shaken and humbled by how far his team had fallen. But in a COVID-shortened season with poor attendance around the league, it was the best possible time to lose big, and it made him realize that the surest way to acquire talent was by having a very high draft pick. A strategy he would return to in each of the next 2 years of the rebuild.\n\nIn the draft, Stone used our FRP on Jalen Green, and 4 of the other picks he had acquired on Alperen Sengun, Usman Garuba, and Josh Christopher, who along with KJ, Tate, and Kevin Porter Jr (acquired for a top-55 protected SRP that would never convey), the youth movement was on.\n\nBut Eric Gordon remained despite rumors that he could have fetched a late FRP, and it wouldn't be until over a year later that he would finally be moved along with the 2023 Milwaukee FRP to acquire the LA Clippers' 2023 FRP.\n\nAnd that was the final farewell to the Harden-Era Rockets.\n\nThis may seem like an overly-long essay, but it's actually an extremely brief recap of the highlights that actually affect the current team's structure. Again, let me reemphasize the vast number of smaller moves that were made along the way as waiver-wire claims and trade returns were able to create SRPs, and SRPs were used to get rid of FRPs. The entire time, attention was paid to preserving cap space for the 2023 FA class, when the Plan was to literally buy our way back into playoff contention just in time to avoid sending a lottery pick to OKC.\n\nBut I can make it briefer:\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nAside from James Harden, Stone was left with very few assets, but managed to turn them into 2, mid-FRPs in 2021 and 2023.\n\nRussell Westbrook and Robert Covington trades were directly responsible for acquiring the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA Draft from Sam Presti. These two players essentially became **Alperen Sengun** (and nothing else...although that alone may be the most impressive work of the rebuild)\n\nPJ Tucker and Eric Gordon turned Jarrett Allen (the best player in the Harden trade return) into **Cam Whitmore**.\n\nIn addition to that non-existent Jarrett Allen piece that eventually became Cam, James Harden has brought back **Tari Eason**, unprotected FRPs from Brooklyn in 2024, 2026, and likely swaps in 2025 and 2027. \n\nTrading away the vets for the draft power to acquire these 3 young players and the Nets' draft future for the next 4 years, also set the team up for failure on a grand enough scale (with an assist from KPJ and Daishen Nix at PG) to acquire 3 straight top-4 picks thanks to winning the figurative coin flip in each draft lottery (an event as unlikely as winning the top overall pick in 1 year, 14%) that would become **Jalen Green**, **Jabari Smith Jr.**, and **Amen Thompson**.\n\nThose 6 guys, along with Tate and BKN's foreseeable draft future represent the next iteration of Championship contention in Houston. Despite all the minor moves that clutter peoples' thoughts, the connections are stark and direct when distilled down to the basics.\n\nThe precious cap space that Stone protected the entire time at the expense of displaying a better product over the last few years was used to stock up on Championship-quality veteran mentors that are currently teaching the kids how to win. But they will fall off the books by the time the young core needs to be extended...or perhaps even traded for additional draft assets.\n\nThanks for reading.

In it, we touched on the crazy ending to the Suns game, Mitchell Robinson's shenanigans, RJ Barrett's improvement, Quentin Grimes' shooting slump, some original reporting on the Knicks' hunt for a star and way more.\n\nThe goal of the podcast is to take you all behind the scenes. I won't stop at just analysis or breakdowns of the big moments. I'm with the team on the road. I'm in the locker room before and after games. I want to share that perspective with the public. And sometimes, a podcast is an even better forum to tell goofy Mitchell Robinson anecdotes or dive into the psyche of a player than a written story could be.\n\nI'll make sure the guests are top notch throughout the show. I will also conduct mailbags regularly, answering questions directly from the listeners.\n\nSubscribe to Katz and Shoot on Patreon for $5 a month and receive one episode a week or subscribe for $10 a month and receive two episodes a week in-season. Subscribing to the $10 tier also gives you the ability to send in questions for the aforementioned mailbags.\n\nCheck out the link to the home page here:\u00a0[https://www.patreon.com/KatzandShoot](https://www.patreon.com/KatzandShoot)\n\nI hope you all enjoy! And because I am a stealth observer of Knicks Reddit (yet don't have enough karma to create posts on my own; I can only reply to posts in the comments, which is why my buddy \\\\u\\\\Swankyyyy is posting this for me). I will happily linger here to answer all questions about the Knicks, the rest of the league or anything else you're curious to know. Feel free to ask me anything in the comments.

Instead of trying to take defenders off the dribble, he's opting to try and overpower them with his back to the basket. \n\nWhy is this significant? When he attacks the basket by backing down his defender and banging against their bodies, he exerts significantly more energy than he would by blowing past them. He also leaves himself extremely vulnerable to double/triple teams, which unfortunately are effective against him. He also just is not a very good post scorer. He doesn't have the length to finish over taller defenders with a jumphook, doesn't have the post moves, and gets called for a bunch of travels when's caught under the basket. \n\nI think the root of this has to do with his confidence in his ball handling.

And with good reason. Not only is the 34-year-old still very productive (21.3 points, 4.6 assists and 3.2 rebounds per in 18 games this season) and thus attractive to contenders who are looking for more firepower, but also his expiring contract ($28.6 million this season) should incentivize Bulls president of basketball operations Art\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas to avoid losing him for nothing in free agency this summer.\n\n&gt;When it comes to possible destinations, the Heat and Knicks are known to be preferable to DeRozan if he winds up getting moved. Our Jovan Buha revealed recently that the Lakers are interested in DeRozan (and former Laker Alex Caruso) more than LaVine, which makes perfect sense to anyone who remembers how LeBron James courted DeRozan three summers ago.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.4112}, {"ranking": 0.3275862068965517, "comments": "Pissed Off Pat is the best version Pat ", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.3275862068965517, "comments": "First 20 Games: Net Ratings and Two-Man Lineups The Bulls have completed the first quarter of games right at the start of December. Here is a snapshot of how they have performed. This looks at individual net ratings and net ratings of two-man and some three-man lineups. I've also included EPM for each player (DPM not updated yet). Obviously, the sample size is still very low and can change dramatically over the next 62 games.\n\nThis didn't consider four-man or five-man lineups because only a few lineups have played a significant amount of minutes together. To be brief, all starting lineups have performed terribly, so all of the most played five and four man lineups have terrible net ratings.\n\n**Three-Man Lineups**:\n\n* Only two three-man lineups with over 100 min together have a positive lineup.\n   * Vucevic, White, Williams = +0.1 in 269 min\n   * LaVine, White, Williams = +6.5 in 204 min\n* There are a lot of bad lineups to choose from:\n   * DeRozan, Vucevic, LaVine = -15.5 in 386 min\n   * Vucevic, Craig, White = -16.3 in 217 min\n   * DeRozan, LaVine, Craig = -33.7 in 124 min\n\n**LaVine:** \n\n* \\+0.5 EPM in 635 min. -7.7 net rating.\n* No positive two-man lineups *besides Carter (+6.3) in limited minutes*.\n* Best with PWill (-1.7).\n* Worst with DeRozan (-17.0) and Craig (-10.0).\n\n**DeRozan:** \n\n* \\-0.5 EPM in 633 min. -12.2 net rating. He has easily the worse defensive rating on the team (119.6).\n* No positive two-man lineups. This is a huge fall from the previous years with the Bulls. DeRozan was usually one of the only players with mostly positive 2-man lineups. Is he playing hurt, or aging badly now, or is the \u2018new\u2019 offense that poor of a fit with him?\n* Best with PWill (-0.6).\n* Very bad with everyone else. Worst is Lavine (-17.0) and Craig (-24.9).\n\n**Vucevic:**\n\n* \\-0.9 EPM in 688 min. -8.1 net rating.\n* No positive two-man lineups except for Ayo (+4.8) and Carter (+7.8 in limited minutes).\n* Best with PWill (-4.4).\n* Worst with DeRozan (-11.9), Craig (-11.6) and Caruso (-10.8).\n\n**White:**\n\n* \\-1.4 EPM in 656 min. -3.5 net rating. He has the second-best offensive rating on the team (111.8).\n* Only has positive lineups with PWill (+5.3) and Ayo (+2.7). In limited minutes, he has also played very well with Carter (+28.9) and Drummond (+25.0). \n* Best with PWill (+5.3).\n* Worst with DeRozan (-10.6). This is VERY strange. They were the best pairing on the team last year.\n\n**Williams:**\n\n* \\-1.5 EPM in 488 min. +0.3 net rating. He has the best offensive rating on the team (112.7) despite terrible shooting so far.\n* Only has positive lineups with White (+5.3), Carter (+5.8) and Drummond (+8.5). He has also played relatively well with DeRozan (-0.6).\n* Best with White (+5.3 in 318 min).\n* Worst with Caruso (-4.7 in 150 min) and Vucevic (-4.4 in 331 min).\n\n**Caruso:**\n\n* \\+1.6 EPM in 408 min. -6.1 net rating.\n* Only has positive lineups with Carter (+2.7) and in limited minutes with Drummond (+6.9 in 94 min). This is VERY strange. The previous years with the Bulls, he has generally had positive lineups with every player with a few exceptions.\n* Best with Carter (+2.7 in 110 min). With more minutes, it\u2019s White (-4.2 in 265 min).\n* Worst with Vucevic (-10.8 in 311 min).\n\n**Dosunmu:** \n\n* \\-2.3 EPM in 300 min. -5.8 net rating. He has the worst offensive rating on the team (102.6).\n* Only has positive minutes with Vucevic (+4.8) and White (+2.7).\n* Best with Vucevic (+4.8 in 152 min).\n* Worst with Drummond (-20.2 in 133 min).\n\n**Carter:** \n\n* \\-1.7 EPM in 288 min. +3.3 net rating. He has the best defensive rating on the team (104.4).\n* Has positive lineups with PWill (+5.8) and Caruso (+2.7).

That, not chasing playoff or play-in games, is the main storyline to this season.\n\n&gt; This will be Karni\u0161ovas\u2019 second roster iteration after inheriting a rebuilding project and blowing it up to trade for Nikola Vucevic, Lonzo Ball and DeMar DeRozan---the latter two in sign-and-trade acquisitions---and sign Alex Caruso in free agency. He also drafted Patrick Williams, Ayo Dosunmu, Dalen Terry and Julian Phillips.\n\n&gt; Only Zach LaVine and Coby White remain from the roster Karni\u0161ovas inherited, and trading LaVine is the main organizational focal point for now. In fact, league sources said that, at least for now, Karni\u0161ovas is responding to inquiries on other players by saying he wants to see what the roster looks like post-LaVine trade first.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.8074}, {"ranking": 0.3275862068965517, "comments": "A positive spin on this disaster Like a lot of you, I was calling for a total tear down at last years trade deadline and in the off-season. Had AKME went in that direction, it would make sense that whatever set of players would be on the team this year would be 5-13.\n\nBut that\u2019s not what AKME did, and yet they are 5-13. With it seeming likely that Zach gets traded soon, it seems like the team is not getting any better this year. The best thing we can hope for at this point is for the L\u2019s to keep piling up so that we can get a high lottery pick next year. Right now they are 5th in the tank standings. Assuming Zach is traded, I hope that DeMar, Vucevic and Caruso are traded too. Jevon Carter and Torrey Craig can be trade pieces as well. Please do all that AKME.

We need a \"sell the team\" campaign now. I typed up a bunch of shit explaining the rationale for why this is necessary then deleted it because it should be self-evident to anyone who's been paying attention to the Bulls for at least a few years (and even more so to someone who's been paying attention for decades) and I'm bad at formulating arguments. (edit: I guess I ended up typing a bunch of shit anyway. whatever)\n\nThe Reinsdorfs are terrible owners and care more about profit than winning. Yeah obviously it's a business, but if the product sucks then why are we supporting it?\n\nRemember, we're talking about the guy (Jerry) who threatened to move the White Sox (which he's said he cares about way more than the Bulls... can't find the quote someone pls halp) to Tampa in the 80s unless the city and state helped him fund a new stadium.\n\nWe're talking about the guy who will NEVER go into the luxury tax to fund a winning team (which is almost necessary in today's NBA) or spend a dime more than he has to.\n\nWe're talking about the guy who famously advised another baseball exec to finish in second place every year and [recently echoed that sentiment](https://chicago.suntimes.com/white-sox/2023/5/3/23709810/jerry-reinsdorf-truth-make-an-appearance-as-white-sox-struggle-rick-hahn-world-series-david-samson):\n\n&gt; The most striking statement had to do with what he thinks the fan base wants in a team.\n\n&gt; \u2018\u2018I think the important thing to fans is, while they want you to win championships, they want to know that when they get down to the last month of the season, you still have a shot,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u2018\u2018You\u2019re still playing meaningful games. If you can do that consistently, you\u2019ll make your fans happy.\u2019\u2019\n\n&gt; The discerning Sox fan will see in that quote shades of the advice former Marlins president David Samson said Reinsdorf once gave him.\n\n&gt; \u2018\u2018I was 32 years old, in baseball for my first of 18 years,\u2019\u2019 Samson said in 2019. \u2018\u2018And [Reinsdorf] said: \u2018You know what? Here\u2019s my best advice to you: Finish in second place every single year because your fans will say, \u2018\u2018Wow, we\u2019ve got a shot, we\u2019re in it,\u2019\u2019 but there\u2019s always the carrot left. There\u2019s always one more step to take.\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n\n&gt; Samson\u2019s quote caused a huge stink. The Sox moved quickly to deny that Reinsdorf ever said such a thing, knowing that an owner who settles for second-best isn\u2019t a good look for a franchise. But Reinsdorf\u2019s comments Monday in front of a group of witnesses at the Milken Institute Global Conference sounded very much like what Samson insisted he once said.\n\nLiterally nothing is going to change until the Reinsdorfs sell the team. AK will get thrown under the bus. Billy will get thrown under the bus. The players will get thrown under the bus. Are they blameless? Are they faultless? Obviously not, but they're playing for an organization that does not care about winning and ultimately will not support them in doing so. The Bulls will either find a new GM (EVP of basketball operations whatever), a new coach, new players who will all meet the same resistance. (or maybe AK can go the GarPax route and get spared just for displaying loyalty to the throne)\n\nAnyway, what the fuck? Why is anyone supporting this? The Oakland A's fans had a massive grassroots campaign recently urging their owner to sell the team. It didn't work, and the jerk-off is moving the team to Vegas anyway, but it got a lot of traction and visibility.

They drive and kick to guys at the 3 point line who lack efficiency from that distance. I rarely see a moving offense with cuts to the basket.

I\u2019ve seen some takes floating around here/Twitter that the Bulls just need to fire Billy and they\u2019ll be way better. I just think that\u2019s flat-out ridiculous, and here\u2019s why: The Bulls have ZERO top-15 guys on the team, and two of our three best players cannot shoot 3\u2019s and don\u2019t really play well in transition. The role players that surround our \u201cbig 3\u201d (lol) cannot shoot 3\u2019s consistently except for Carter. What coach on planet Earth would be able to cook up a top-15 offense with that roster? Hint: the answer is nobody. I\u2019ll agree with people who say that Billy is not a very good offensive coach and isn\u2019t very creative on that end of the floor (seems to be a common theme with Bulls coaches for some reason), but he is at least a solid defensive coach, and most players I\u2019ve seen that have ever talked about him have nothing but great things to say (outside of Zach, who hasn\u2019t bad-mouthed Billy at all, but he is allegedly still upset about being benched over a year ago when he was 1-14 or something like that. And then you have some people who somehow think that coaches like Spo or Pop wouldn\u2019t have done the exact same thing).\n\nAll of that being said, I do think Donovan shouldn\u2019t be the coach of this team for much longer because of how non-creative he is on offense (and because it\u2019s pretty obvious the whole team, including Billy, is checked out), but please, let\u2019s not act like this team is going to turn a corner if all we do is let go of Billy. This roster needs to be torn down completely (outside of the young guys), and if AK/ME don\u2019t at least trade Zach and Caruso at the deadline (I would throw DeMar and Vuc in there as well, but I\u2019d imagine their contracts are more difficult to trade) then I\u2019d argue they\u2019re no better (if not worse) than GarPax. This roster is inherently flawed, and the only solution to this problem is for the front office to finally acknowledge their mistakes and get as many assets as they can for our best players. \n\nAnd if we really wanna talk about the main problem, then it\u2019s really the Reinsdorfs.

The Bulls haven't adjusted to losing Lonzo. If Coby White's in, then either Demar is left out; or, you start Carter and build an offense around having all of White/Derozan/Lavine off-ball. It's clear Donovan has lost the locker room.No one on this team believes in their collective selves. Often, their top two fold and look for their own. \n\n\nI say put them out of their misery. Move Demar ASAP, since he's the only one who can't compliment a White/Lavine backcourt, and you want time to evaluate the rest of the roster (before trade deadline). His shots can go to a Lavine/White/PWill big three and they can be properly assessed in more favorable and consistent playstyles and line-ups. \n\n\nSame with Donovan.\n\n\nHe can get one more chance with a better fitting roster and a trade of the captain to light a fire under everyone. Hopefully they look at the 2014 suns and Jeff Hornacek for some ideas based on the Dragic/Bledsoe pairing. Worst case scenario they lose more games and better their lottery odds while raising the trade value of their players ahead of the deadline.\n\n\nAs for trade partners...\n\n\n I think the Spurs would be the best fit for him because he answers a lot of their basketball needs, but also: Wemby is the perfect fit for him. In fact, Derozan has never actually played with his ideal pairing mate. That being a tall/athletic big who can hit threes, screen and roll, and iso/create on one end; while protecting the rim AND covering the perimeter on the other. Not a lot of players can do that obviously but that's what Derozan has always needed to cover his weaknesses in the modern era. \n\n\nBasketball-wise, they get a ball handler, play-maker and all-nba level scorer. All in a guy who's played under pop before in the exact role they need. More so, he is aging with a game that should allow him to transition to more of a playmaker/shooter without losing much production.  Pop don't have time to tank again. They would be competitive this season if it worked out. Then Derozan could re-sign, and be The Butler AND The Robin to Wemby's Batman in his \"twilight-prime.\"\n\n\nThat's the ideal fit as fan, hopefully they accept a few seconds just to move him to the right spot and get something back for the expiring.

That meant he played with the [1997-2002 uniforms](https://www.bballjerseys.com/hornets?pgid=lp201wov1-3798889d-b01c-403d-91e8-f64e06cf30a6).

I\u2019ve seen him being criticized for not being able to the play the PG position and rightfully so as he it doesn\u2019t seem like he can. Just look at season, he completely failed to get his teammates involved and he was super inefficient as a scorer.\n\nHis season so far has been an interesting one. While his 3 point shooting has been really off he has made up for it with his finishing and mid-range as he managed to score 20+ points in all 6 of his games. He played really well last night against the Magic as he had a very efficient 22 points and made 9 assists. However, he did also have 5 turnovers and 4 fouls. Here\u2019s to hoping we get 2020-21 Terry who managed to take over and lead his team to a play-in spot rather than 2022-23 Terry who sometimes missed contested 3\u2019s and sometimes missed more contested 3\u2019s.\n\nThe Hornets don\u2019t really have any other options at the 1 spot as while Theo Maledon is a good defender he is my opinion the worst scorer in the league and Ish Smith is just Terry Rozier but bad. Also if you\u2019re thinking about NSJ starting at the 1, please stop. I am high on him but he\u2019s still really raw and even less of a PG than Terry.\n\n**Is Brandon Miller our saviour?:**\nAs I previously said, with LaMelo Ball out they will most likely play Terry as the starting PG but that also means that Brandon Miller will likely be the starting SG. \n\nDespite the Hornets losing, Brandon Miller absolutely destroyed the Knicks in his 2 previous games against them. In his first game against the Knicks he got injured at the start of the 2nd quarter but he was absolutely on fire in that game. Recording 11 points and 3 rebounds in less than 10 minutes of play. His shooting numbers were excellent as he shot 5-6 from the field and 1-2 from 3. In his second game against the Knicks he had a career high 29 points. His shooting was once again amazing as he shot 10-16 from the field, 5-7 on 3\u2019s and 4-4 on FT\u2019s. For the Hornets to even have the possibility of winning this game Brandon Miller needs to have another amazing performance against the Knicks.\n\n**Gordon Hayward &amp; PJ Washington:**\nIn his 5 games since his hamstring injury, Gordon Hayward has averaged 8 PPG on 32.6 MPG. He has had shooting splits of 28/25/75 shooting splits. PJ Washington is as inconsistent ever and is shooting a career low 31.3% from 3 for the season. I hope PJ has 30 bomb rather than a 3 bomb, there isn\u2019t much say about him as he is pretty much impossible to predict. For Gordon there isn\u2019t as much hope. While I am expecting Hayward to do better than 8 points on 28/25/75 shooting, I still think he will play poorly until the Hornets\u2019 8 day break where he will be forced to rest up.\n\n**Mark Williams vs Mitchell Robinson:**\nThis is no doubt the worst matchup for Mark Williams in the entire NBA. Mark struggles the most against big rebounding centers who can protect the rim and that is literally just a description of Mitch. \n\nIn Mark\u2019s last game against the Knicks he had a statline of 7/8/4/0/1 on 3-5 FG. In the earlier game against the Knicks he had 10/4/2/2/0 on 4-5 but in just 23 minutes of play. Neither of those statlines seem that bad but they are because outside of just protecting the rim, controlling the boards is Mark\u2019s biggest job and we can\u2019t do that shot opportunites don\u2019t open up for him as much and the Hornets just generally get less chances to score. \n\nMark has however done a solid job defending Robinson as Robinson is averaging 7 PPG on 58.3% FG% against Mark this season. 58.3% from the field is actually bad considering he only takes shots right below the basket. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m scared of Mitch having some sort of Shaq-like performance, it\u2019s just the Knicks controlling the boards will really hurt the Hornets. I honestly wouldn\u2019t be suprised if neither center manages to crack double digit points.", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.5567}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "Game Thread: Charlotte Hornets (5-10) at New York Knicks (9-7) Nov 28 2023 7:30 PM #Charlotte Hornets at New York Knicks\n\nMadison Square Garden- New York, NY\n\n[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584145)\n\n[TV/Radio](/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/185tho3/game_thread_charlotte_hornets_510_at_new_york/kb3oo1j/)\n\n\n\n***\n\n|Time Clock|\n|:--:|\n|Final|\n\n||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|CHA |16|28|22|25|91|\n|NYK |29|24|27|35|115|\n\n###On the court\n\n**Charlotte Hornets**\n\n|Player|MINS|PTS|FGM-A|3PM-A|FTM-A|ORB|DRB|REB|AST|STL|BLK|TO|PF|+/-|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|J.

I saw a lot of people saying it was gonna take some time for him to shake off the rust but he came swinging (no pun intended) right out of the gate. He has also been one of the best defenders on the team this season. The thing that has impressed me the most is that he hasn\u2019t any bad games, he has been doing a lot of stuff outside of scoring that we didn\u2019t see a lot of in previous years. The only bad scoring game he has had was against the Celtics when he scored 14 shooting 3-13 from the field but he made up for it with 15 rebounds, 5 assists and some super important plays in the clutch. He also hit all 6 of his free throws. He played really well toinght leading the Hornets in scoring with 23 points on 9-17 FG and managing to 10 rebounds.\n\nsource:\n\nhttps://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/miles-bridges-stats-this-season", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": 0.9761}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "LaMelo Ball Is Carried Off the Court After Strange Injury - Doctor Explains ", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": -0.5574}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "In case anybody cares about the in-season tournament...in order to make a wildcard.

Going with the gf and want it to be a great night **So full disclosure:** I'm a born &amp; raised Knicks fan but I'm also a huge LaMelo fan too and have been watching the Hornets for the last few year now. I'm super excited now that Miles Bridges is back on the court and can't wait to see a Melo-Bridges alley oop in-person\n\nShort story long.. I'm actually flying to Cabo Mexico for a close friends wedding a few days prior and for the flight back to nyc, I purposely chose a 24+ hour layover in Charlotte. Lucky for me, there's a game at 7pm on 1/10 (we land at 5:45pm). I was enticed by the Black Friday No Fees deal and snagged Section 105 Row A1 tickets, Seats 19 &amp; 20. They are inner circle tickets and come with parking, buffet, waiter service. With taxes, about 500 each.\n\nTruth be told, normally I would never drop this kinda money on tickets for anything but this is my first vacation in quite and  (rather impulsively) figured I'd treat myself to my first near-courtside NBA experience, while showing the gf a 'once in a lifetime' night out too. Last year as a perk of my job, I sat legit middle courtside to a Long Island Nets VS Swarm D-League game at Nassau Coliseum and got to watch Gelo light it up. I was cheering his name and he legit looked at me like \"who the hell is this random dude screaming my name on Long Island\" Lol\n\nLooking at the tickets in my account, I saw that I have the option of selling them for about $200 total profit. I'm debating doing so and picking up a different pair in the following cheaper (yet still pretty good) seats:\n\n**Section 106, Row A2** behind the visitors bench\n\n* Inner club, very close\n* worried might not have best visibility when players stand\n* but also great to see them see them up close and personal\n* with proceeds from selling my tickets, would be about $300 all in before taxes\n\n**Section 105, Row M or P, Seats 11/12** ($186 each)\n\n* Read on Reddit that sitting 10-15 rows back in section 105 or 114 allows to really watch the plays unfold, but is it too far?\n* Access to the Flight Deck  and private club lounges\n* with proceeds from selling my tickets, would be about $172 all in before taxes\n\n**Section 107, Row E or Row F ($118 each)**\n\n* most inexpensive of the bunch, interesting view of the game\n* with proceeds from selling my tickets, would be about $40 all in before taxes\n\n**Section 109, A3 8/9 ($153 each)**\n\n* Cool angle and very very close to the action at the rim\n* somewhat obstructed view by the hoop\n\n**Current Seats: 105 Row A1** 19/20 ($495 each): Great location, great view, plenty of legroom in front, inner circle, can see player in the tunnel, comped buffet and beer/wine, maybe see celebs?\n\nThe reasonable side of my brain says that I should use the \"free money\" from selling original seats on cheaper tix and save difference in price for airbnb, car rental, miscellaneous items for mexico trip, etc but the other side of my brain says \"Stick the plan... you deserve to splurge work hard to secure bonus and upcoming promotion at work... besides, YOLO!\"\n\n# Sorry for the essay but I'm just torn/excited.

It\u2019s no secret that LaMelo &gt;!LaFrance!&lt; Ball has been playing well recently as I\u2019ve started to see lots of posts on this sub about it and people outside of the Hornets fanbase are finally starting to talk about it. But I do feel like you need to compare LaMelo to others and show what kind of company he is in to really understand just how good he is playing. \n\nThese are the statlines he has put up during this 9 game stretch:\n\n30/10/13 on 61.7% TS vs The Mavs\n\n34/4/7 on 67.8% TS vs The Wizards\n\n25/6/6 on 60.2% TS vs The Wizards\n\n32/7/6 on 76.6% TS vs The Knicks\n\n28/6/11 on 48.9% TS vs The Heat\n\n37/5/5 on 55.6% TS vs The Bucks\n\n34/5/9 on 74.3% TS vs The Knicks\n\n36/9/8 on 65.6% TS vs The Celtics\n\n34/8/13 on 52.6% TS vs The Wizards\n\nHe is averaging 32.2/6.7/8.7/1.4/0.3 on 49/44/88 splits or 61.5% TS. I will now show you what his stretch looks like when compared with some of the best players in the league.\n\n**LaMelo Ball has the second longest active streak of 25+ point games:** LaMelo has had 9 25+ point games in a row now and the only player in the league with a longer active streak is KD (the best scorer in the world) with 14. He is tied with Embiid (the current NBA scoring leader) for 3rd as he previously had a 9 game streak and is behind Jokic (the best player in the world) as he previously had a 10 game streak.\n\n**LaMelo Ball is averaging the most PPG out of anyone in the league since November 15th:** Since November 15th LaMelo has played 4 games and has averaged 35.3 PPG. That is the most out of anyone in the league.\n\n**LaMelo Ball has had the longest streak of 34+ point games this season, let alone 34+/5+/5+ games:** LaMelo Ball has had a streak of 4 34/5/5 games this season, no other player has even just scored 34 points 4 games in a row this season. Not only that but this is an active streak, he will have the chance to add onto these incredible numbers.\n\nIf you want you can be more nitpicky and find more ridiculous sats like these. For example, **LaMelo\u2019s 9 game streak of 25+/4+/5+ games is the longest out of anyone this season.** Also it\u2019s active.\n\nLaHimlo.", "date": "20231123", "sentiment": 0.9934}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "Happy Thanksgiving  ", "date": "20231123", "sentiment": 0.5719}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "Kai Jones On His Social Media Posts (Podcast) ", "date": "20231123", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "BONK ", "date": "20231123", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "When do our injured players come back?

The Washington Wizards are one of the few teams in the league who not only have a worse record than the Hornets but also a worse net rating. Despite missing Terry Rozier and Nick Richards, the Hornets should definetly beat the Wizards tonight.\n\n**Mark Williams, the potential X-factor:**\nIt\u2019s no secret that Mark Williams has been playing well this season. In just 26.6 minutes per game he is averaging a statline of 13.8/10.0/1.5/0.9/0.8 while leading the leading the league in FG%, eFG% and TS%. He continues to be a good defender as he consistently improves the Hornets\u2019 defense from pretty much everywhere on the court. He is also fresh off of a monster performance against Boston where he put up a statline of 18/16/2/1/3 and had the game high +/- of +33. \n\nThe Wizards are a perfect matchup for Mark Williams as he is good at utilizing his length and does an amazing job controlling the boards against weaker rebounding teams. This was evident in the Hornets\u2019 last two games against the Wizards. In the first one he only played 18 minutes likely due to foul trouble, the Wizards quickly blowing out the Hornets and just some strange coaching decisions by Clifford but he was incredibly efficient in those 18 minutes. He managed to record 14 points on a perfect 5-5 shooting, 7 rebounds and 1 block. He also had the highest +/- out of anyone on this team other than NSJ and Leaky Black who only played 4 minutes that were in garbage time. In the second game he managed to record 21 points and 24 rebounds and set a new franchise record for the Hornets. He had the most offensive rebounds by anyone in Charlotte Hornets history with 15! Daniel Gafford actually did good job defending Mark Williams 1-on-1 but that really didn\u2019t matter since Mark could just grab his miss and get infininte chances. He also had a team high +/- of +19 that game. With Nick Richards still out Mark Williams get a lot of playing time. In his past 3 games he has played more minutes in each game than any other game this season. Everything seems to be in favour of Mark having another monster performance.\n\n**LaMelo Ball:**\nI will be quick as there isn\u2019t a lot to say other than that LaMelo Ball is amazing. In his last 8 games he\u2019s averaging an MVP-caliber statline of 32.0/6.1/8.5/1.5/0.4 and doing so on 63% TS. The guy is insane, he has the worst stretch of his career (he had good reasons but still) and then immediatly follows it up with a 30 point Triple-Double and the best stretch of his career. Praying that this insane stretch continues.\n\n**Miles Bridges:**\nIt feels weird to talk about him. I honestly don\u2019t care about anyone\u2019s opinion on his situation so I\u2019m just gonna skip over it. He\u2019s on the team now and that\u2019s that. I do have to admit that despite how I feel about him he is an incredible basketball player. In his first 3 games this season, he is averaging a statline of 16.7/8.0/4.0/1.3/0.3 and has a TS% of 57.8%. In his last game he actually only shot 3-13 from the field but hit a crucial 3, hit all 6 of his free throws, recorded 15 rebounds and 5 assists. He will likely be the biggest difference between our 2 prior games against Washington and this one as outside of him just being a reallly good scorer he is also a pretty good playmaker for a PF and one of the Hornets\u2019 better defenders.", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9984}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "Game Thread: Washington Wizards (2-11) at Charlotte Hornets (4-9) Nov 22 2023 7:00 PM #Washington Wizards at Charlotte Hornets\n\nSpectrum Center- Charlotte, NC\n\n[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584853)\n\n[TV/Radio](/r/CharlotteHornets/comments/1816m4d/game_thread_washington_wizards_211_at_charlotte/kaaazqr/)\n\n\n\n***\n\n|Time Clock|\n|:--:|\n|Final|\n\n||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|WAS |24|32|35|23|114|\n|CHA |21|28|29|39|117|\n\n###On the court\n\n**Washington Wizards**\n\n|Player|MINS|PTS|FGM-A|3PM-A|FTM-A|ORB|DRB|REB|AST|STL|BLK|TO|PF|+/-|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|K.

It may be quite a hot take for some, but hear me out. This is a hypothetical so in this case we have enough picks and assets that the post-imploded Bulls wants. That may not happen at all in real life, but lets start with the discussion.\n\nLavine is an all star level player, yes, but his pay is all star level too. He's currently being paid nearly 1/3 of the cap space, and would be paid for the next 2/3 years still, depending on his player option. Is locking up a third of our cap to a person really worth it, after we already locked up nearly the same amount for Lamelo starting next year? Remember, he\"s 28 so if we want to have optimal use of his talents we should already be competing like last week, but every hornets fan and their mothers know that this season is shot. Would trading for him fix our roster issues and this season, or is it just a bandaid solution to the fact that our coach is outdated? I dont really know, but I dont think his addition makes us a playoff team, not now, not in a couple of years.\n  \nSecondly, he wont solve our backcourt defense. Lamelo has shown he can be a good defender in spurts, but he cant do that and focus on carrying the offense and making plays at the same time. We are using Brandon Miller as our point of attack defender and while his length affects some players, he is ineffective against large bodies and is prone to rookie mistakes. Can Lavine fix that issue and be our main defender instead? I don't think so. He isn't bottom of the barrel per se, but while he is serviceable on ball he is bad at off-ball and lacks instincts. Caruso, in the other hand, is great both at POA and at off-ball defense, and his bounce surprises people especially if he blocks them.  \n  \nCaruso is also only getting paid a quarter of Lavine at about 10 million. In comparison, that's like 1/3 of what we're paying Hayward.  \n  \nA thing that might sour people on Caruso is that he's not really a scorer. His 3P is also below average. And what I might counter to that is, well, nothing. Because on the offensive side the best thing we need to do is to have Lamelo, Miller and Mark develop chemistry on that side of the court. Removing touches from our young core is not really advisable, I'm thinking long term here. I mean I only listed the young core, but we still have MB, PJ, Hayward or Rozier to score (whomever is not traded in this hypothetical). Lavine would need at least 15 FGA per game (from his playing history). If we traded Rozier that would be where his touches would come from but would the Bulls want his contract? What if they wanted Hayward's contract so they'll have a free cap space next year? We'd have to get about 5 more attempts from other players if that happens. While he isnt a shooter Caruso is most definitely a cutter, and Lamelo could feed him a lot of easy layups from distracted defenders focusing on other shooters just like how Lebron did.  \n  \nSo yeah, TLDR, if the Bulls implode, we need to trade for Caruso before ever thinking of Lavine because 1) he's paid a lot less, 2) we arent forced to adapt to his timeframe 3) he fixes our backcourt defense and 4) he doesnt demand.a lot of touches.  I havent even started on how we might not have enough assets to trade for Lavine in the first place so we should settle for Caruso instead.\n  \nThoughts?

The two things holding back LaMelo the most (aside from injuries of course) have always been his finishing and defense. He has always been one of the worst finishers the league despite being very tall for a point guard (6\u20197\") and his 2P% dropping more and more each season has not exactly been a good look. However, despite his terrible start to the season it seems like this year might be different.\n\nLaMelo\u2019s 2P% this season has been 48.8%, still bad but it\u2019s the best he has shot since his rookie season where he shot 48.9%. Not only that but he\u2019s shooting 75% from Inside 3 feet of the basket, he has never shot even 60% from that range for a full season.\n\nHis percentage looks even better if you only include his last 4 games where he has shot 61.2% from 2. You can even extend that to the last 6 games and you\u2019ll still be left with a solid 56.1%. He\u2019s shooting (almost) the best he ever has from 2 and that\u2019s despite starting the season super rusty because of his injuries. I mean the dude shot 25% on his 2 pointers for his first 3 games of the season. His finishing has been improving every single game. He literally shot 9-12 on 2 pointers in his last game that just so happened to be against the Knicks, the 5th best defense in the league.\n\nDo you think LaMelo has improved as a finsiher and do you think this is something that will be sustainable, not only for this season but for years to come? He doesn\u2019t even need to shoot 61.2%, just consistently being above 50% would be a massive improvement and help him take that next step as a player.", "date": "20231114", "sentiment": 0.9933}, {"ranking": 0.1206896551724138, "comments": "Where to buy Jerseys?

Obviously the shooting has gotten much better after his rookie season and he\u2019s over 40% in a not insignificant sample since then. Not a volume shooter but he is dependable and not afraid to shoot it.\n\nThe man plays basketball the right way. Elite cutter, very underrated passer, consistently good finisher with hops. He\u2019s a connector. Not a lot of creative chops but there\u2019s more there than most people think. He can grab and go, run the occasional pick and roll without tumbling over himself.\n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s a plus defender on his own but he has the tools and the brains to be a really good one with consistent burn. On that end, he plays bigger than his size because of length and athleticism.\n\nI know he\u2019s older and has limited upside compared to several other players but he is a legitimately good player, one who could be our 8th-9th guy on a Kenrich contract for the next few years. \n\nCheap, reliable wings who can stay on the floor against all kinds of opponents are so valuable and the team is playing the likes of Lindy, Dieng or Bertans over him. Yes, Dieng is young and has potential but he is legitimately one of the worst players in the league. Lindy and Bertans are just not viable NBA players.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why Wiggins is not a regular rotation guy. I truly don\u2019t.

I see a lot of talk about us getting a rebounder in, and I absolutely agree. Chet is great, jdub is great, but between them it's proven to be quite difficult to get a solid rebound as chet struggles to deal with stronger centres and dub is still a bit smaller than a lot of 4's. \n\nWould you offer a multitude of picks to someone like Utah for Kessler for example? He removes some spacing and likely congests the paint which takes away from chets ability to attack inside which is a concern, but he would help us rebound and makes our rim protection ridiculous.\n\nWould you offer Houston a bunch for someone like Jabari? Still young, can space, has a bit of a bigger frame than chet and adds another big body to rebound. Also good defensively.\n\nWould you chase someone like Lively from Dallas and see how many picks they'd ask for? Run chet at the 5 still and have lively at the 4? \n\nIve seen a lot of fans suggest we empty the coffers for a superstar. I see the merit, but i disagree as i think we should aim younger/ for a potential superstar so we have cintinued longevity with the team.

Slow day on work today so I said why not share them in discuss them here. \n\n-We kinda expected in the summer that we had talent and the rest of the nba was super underestimating us. Most people here were confident and it\u2019s important to remember that always the rest of the nba is going to look down to the Thunder, at least until we get a cup. Next time we struggle, don\u2019t lose your trust to our team \u2764\ufe0f\n\n-Chet blew my expectations. He is awesome. We knew he could play, but he is a tough dude that really wants to win and plays hard. These shots in the final minutes he made in a few games now, are awesome and help SGA to trust him a lot. He is our 2nd star\n\n- JDub, what a great man. He has improved from last year in many categories. He plays hard in both sides and takes more and more responsibilities. I believe will be our 3rd star\n\n- The truth is for Dort I am biased because I like these type of players. He has some off games but his defense is gold. He is trying to hard to fill whatever the team needs. We need someone to take charge in offense, he will do it ( like the game where sga was off), we need help in rebounds, he attacks them every time. I want him to stay forever, hopefully we will find a way to pay him what he deserves.\n\n- Giddey, well I m not going to say anything about the allegations. Whoever is booing him is an idiot and needs to do something else with their life. Let police and justice speak first, until then he is innocent to my eyes. For his game however, unfortunately he has not improved as we hoped. His shot is inconsistent and in playoffs this will be a problem. In defense the first games were horrible, now he tries a little harder at least. I believe we should trial with him coming off the bench leading the plays when sga is resting. He is still a great player and I am sure many teams will want him when the allegations are cleared, we shouldn\u2019t forget how young he is and the potential is definitely there. However some people may need to chance environments to improve further and maybe with Giddey we are heading there. \n\n- Joe is not a sniper, is a killer. I admit that I am sceptical with shooters coming off the bench because when we had Morrow he was great and had some great game in season but for these guys it\u2019s not easy to get open shots in playoffs. Also the other teams are hitting them harder in offense and they can be a liability. But Joe is proving he is more like a 6th man player. He tries in defense and had a huge game last night. He also can drive or shoot the mid shot. We could also trial to give him the starting spot (from Giddey) next to sga as I believe they should spend a lot of minutes together \n\n- Wallace is the 2nd player who surprised me. This man is balling from day 1. Can shot, can attack and is a mini Dort in defense. The future is going to be bright and I am just happy he has many years in the rookie contract left and hopefully somehow we will manage to pay him for long term. It\u2019s too early to dwell into contract details of course but with all this talent, tough decisions may come in the future.\n\n- Kenny Hustle, probably is the 2nd most valuable player from the bench. Not always his shots will go in, but he always is going to play excellent mature defense and go for the rebounds, the area we are struggling. Great personality too (even though all of our guys are great in this so hard to point someone)\n\n- Jwill yeah similar story. However Jwill needs to hesitate less in his shots. Sometimes he is too eager to give the pass. Great guy overall though, and we need to respect him for sacrificing his body defending much bigger people. He shouldn\u2019t play as center maybe but that\u2019s what he need him to do \n\n-Wiggins yeah I get why people are sad to not see more minutes from him, however the answer is clear. We know what Wiggins brings to the table and is great. In playoffs I expect him to have more consistent minutes but on the other hand we also need to try the other guys too.  We struggle less in offense and peripheral defense and more in rebounding category and interior help so I agree with Mark testing many things. However Wiggins is staying and we need him\n\n- Waters is having some flashes. I don\u2019t really mind Mark giving him opportunities this early in year but I expect him to be more likely in reserve to replace injuries other than having consistent role in the end of the year. Unless the flashes become something more\n\n- Poku has the body and the potential is there for sure, but right now he is more in reserve unfortunately. Not sure this will change in OKC unfortunately\n\n- T Mann people also say about him that is underplayed. He stayed with team in summer, but with Wallace balling I just don\u2019t see him having minutes left. Wallace is shooting great from 3, great spot shooter and at the same time plays hard defense. We also have Wiggins and Joe to take offensive plays from the bench and they also are much better in defense. Yeah he may be able to play iso but we have the best iso player in the league and our other needs are greater. Agree with idea to be traded, I like him and may he has a better chance elsewhere \n\n- Micic, admittedly is not playing as I expected. I also follow euroleage and I had high expectations for him. However he is not there. I would give him time and more opportunities as the season progresses though, people need time to transition\n\n- Bertans needs also more time and the changes to his contract are great. The problem is that he was never a good rebounder despite his size.\n\n- Mark is amazing coach. Now it\u2019s the time to try different schemes. It\u2019s such a nice change from Brooks and Donovan to have a modern playing style in offense\n\n*SGA is our king. Am I the only one who get vibes from Kobe when I see him play? Super excited to see him playing strong defense while he is one of the best scorers in the league. \n\nWhat\u2019s your thoughts?", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9998}, {"ranking": 0.7068965517241379, "comments": "[Scotto] Sources: The OKC Thunder and Davis Bertans agreed to a contract revision.

Thunder really swarmed on defense.   Thunder fared pretty well in the first half on rebounding.   Lakers fatigue was likely a factor there.\n\n4.  JDub had a very nice efficient first half.   Good to see him getting into the flow of the game.  He\u2019s so fluid.  Not as fluid as SGA but probably second on the team in that category.  \n\n5.

Wiggins also played well in his limited minutes and gave quality minutes in the first half.   He\u2019s a nice depth player who can score.\n\n9.  Giddey was his usual lackluster self.

As the title states, every thunder fan needs to relax. We are currently 17 games into the season, or, 20.7% of the way through it. We have been playing out of our minds with shooting %'s that we should have expected to regress to a degree. \n\nThe team is still incredibly young. Extremely young. We barely made the play in last season and didn't even get into the play off's. Teams rarely, if ever, make the jump from play in to finals contenders like this sub seems to expect. \n\nWe have improved a great deal, that is undefinable. But we were not making an 8 spot jump in standings if we are being realistic. Mark is also young. Very young in terms of career experience. He was not a relatively well known coach before coming to okc and he, alongside the rest of this squad have a lot to learn and work out. Stop calling for his head/resignation/whatever other extreme reaction half this place seems to want. He will work it out, and if anyone has their thumb on the pulse of the team, it's certainly not us couch coaches. \n\nThe giddey stuff has thrown an extremely unfavourable microscope on the entirety of okc. It would no doubt be causing a lot of discomfort for all of our players and the reaction from some before anything concrete has come out from any verifiable source does not help. \n\nWe have a few glaring holes in our on court game. Mostly a lack of size and rebounding. On top of this the addition of chet seems to have nullified a lot of giddeys starting 5 use. I have seen multiple instances of him being stuck on the 3pt wing while the rest of the team is finding  the offence. \n\nWe will likely lose at least 50% of our next 10 games as we have a very tough schedule ahead.

Firstly, this has nothing to do with the Giddey situation or all the accompanying slander.  \n\nWhile we are still experimenting with lineups and building out our team identity, based on a variety of data points I believe we should test Isaiah Joe in the starting spot with Josh Giddey coming off the bench as 6M (sharing few minutes with Shai).\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to read all the data below, the quick summary is that Joe+X(+Y) duos/trios are massively overperforming not only for the team but for the entire NBA, while Giddey+X(+Y) generally are not performing well; but that there are certain bench players that he combines well with for us (generally against other bench units).  \n\nThus, I\u2019d like to see Joe tested in a starting role with a minutes increase; with Giddey seeing a light minute reduction and a role leading the bench unit (roughly swap their minutes; 27-28ish MPG for Joe and 20-2ish for Josh).  \n\n**My reasoning and some data points:**\n\n* The SGA + Giddey pairing works poorly.  SGA scores 59 points per 100 possessions with Giddey off, vs 31 with him on -- a whopping 25 point differential.  Josh scores 20 with Shai vs 23.5 without.  The net rating of this duo is just 4.1, the third lowest of any duo on our team with 200+ minutes.  Neither player props the other up; their play style when combined over indexes on playmaking and midrange at the expense of 3P shooting (since we only have 1 plus 3P shooter starting in Chet, if you assume Dort\u2019s 42% due to a hot 8-game start will regress toward the mean: 53% first 8 vs 29% second 8 games and ~33%ish career average).  \n\n* Conversely, SGA + Joe has the highest net rating *in the entire league* (200+ minute played) at 21.9 \u2013 not only is the offensive rating a scorching 124.5 (highest in the top 10 by at least 2 points) but the defensive rating is the fourth best of the top 10.  This tells me that either Joe is a perfectly fine defender, or that we are able to surround this duo with plus defenders (which we have a lot of) enough to far offset any defensive woes due to his smaller size (note: Joe\u2019s wingspan is the same as Josh\u2019s, at 6\u20197.5\u201d)\n\n* Additionally, Joe + Chet is the second best net rating duo on OKC when reducing the minutes count to 100 (136 minutes for this duo); this would still be the fifteenth best duo in the league even when reducing the minutes (the results get pretty wonky once you start reducing due to signal noise; #1 is Jrue Holiday + Payton Pritchard, for example)\n\n* SGA + Chet + Joe is our second best trio when reducing the minutes (98 minutes) and a top 6 trio NBA-wide when setting the minutes to 90+; our #1 best trio is SGA + Joe + Jalen Williams (83 minutes); hey, he\u2019s another starter!\n\n* Isaiah Joe is basically the best 3P shooter in the league at the moment (second most makes per 36 to only Steph, with a far far higher % than anyone near the top), while I believe playing fine defense.  His 48.5% from three may not be not sustainable, but it *might* be, also \u2013 guys like Joe Harris, Kyle Korver have hit 47, 48 and even higher for full seasons; but even at like a 42-44% the offensive gravity is huge) And frankly, Joe just hustles way harder on defense than Giddey.  Outside of the eye test, Joe has a 105 Drtg while Josh has 111, which again points to him being a solid defender.  And again, while Joe is about 5\u201d shorter they have the same wingspan.\n\n* Giddey +X (+Y) duos/trios don\u2019t rank anywhere near the top for us; BUT the Giddey + Dub and Giddey + Chet duos do work decently (Jalen just +1 with Giddey on, but a +6.6 net rating, Chet +8 with Giddey on; +6.1 net rating which are the two best of any Giddey + X duo).  Giddey also has solid net rating combinations with several of our bench players like Kenny and Wiggins.\n\nStill, Giddey gets the majority of his minutes with Shai despite this combination not working well (277 with vs 156 without; 62% of Giddey\u2019s minutes).  Thankfully, Joe gets the majority of his minutes with Shai (237 with vs 91 without; 72%) but he doesn\u2019t get enough with Chet despite that pairing working really well (136 with vs 192 without; just 41%, and that SGA+Joe+Chet trio only having 98 minutes played)\n\nThus, my proposal would be to start Joe and have Giddey run the bench, finding the extra minutes for Joe by running him in Chet lineups more frequently after the first quarter (for context Shai and Chet generally get around 2/3sish of their minutes with each other, so there\u2019s plenty of room to increase Joe\u2019s minutes with Shai a bit and Chet a lot)\n\n**TL;DR**: Start Isaiah Joe, Josh runs the bench unit.  Light minutes increase for Joe and decrease for Giddey to sustain.  \nLet me know what you think!  \n\nData sources: \n\n* [Lineups: NBA (filter around on this)]( https://www.nba.com/stats/lineups/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*90&amp;GroupQuantity=3&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=0&amp;dir=D&amp;slug=advanced&amp;sort=NET_RATING)\n\n* NBA.com for individual defensive ratings\n\n* [PBP]( https://www.pbpstats.com/on-off/nba/player?Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=Regular%2BSeason&amp;TeamId=1610612760&amp;PlayerId=1628983) for some player combination on/offs\n\n* And then some bball ref here and there", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9982}, {"ranking": 0.7068965517241379, "comments": "Dort Is Dort just not being a productive offensive player acceptable with the incredible defense he plays?

I know we all know he's bad on defense but watching some of these clips in isolation will really make you realize it. \n\nBertans played \\~5 minutes in a stretch at the start of the 4th against the Sixers. During this time they made 5 field goals. 4 of these were almost entirely a result of Bertans being out of position/forcing a miscommunication on the defensive end. I only looked at these 6 made field goals so it's entirely possible he was having serious lapses on other plays that just led to free throws or happened to be misses but here are the 4 below. \n\n[Sixers 94 OKC 87](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=575&amp;GameID=0022300239&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Covington%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(6%20PTS)%20(Maxey%203%20AST))\n\nFirst this one at the top of the 4th. Maxey has the ball at the top of the key with Dort on him. Bertans is on Covington. Covington sets a slip screen for Dort who chases around it easily and then pops out for a three. Bertans switches onto Maxey and shuffles backwards into the paint leaving Covington wide open. Maxey sees the crowd and knows there's an open man and dishes to Covington who hits the 3 before Bertans can recover to properly contest despite Dort's best effort to make up for it. \n\n[Sixers 97 OKC 90](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=583&amp;GameID=0022300239&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Maxey%2018%27%20Pullup%20Jump%20Shot%20(21%20PTS))\n\nReverse of the other play and likely the reason for this miscommunication. Covington sets a proper screen here (a fairly illegal one at that) and Bertans reacts late to the switch and just gets absolutely torched by Maxey.\n\n[Sixers 100 OKC 93](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=596&amp;GameID=0022300239&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Covington%2026%27%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(9%20PTS)%20(Beverley%203%20AST))\n\nThis is the same play... AGAIN. Here Dort gets around the screen with some difficulty and Bertans doesn't really do anything too wrong - he just has hips flipped to guard Maxey properly after the last play and takes too long to react to the switch as a result leaving Covington open again. To be entirely fair to Bertans based on this pattern this clearly was a play designed to create these defensive miscommunications - he just managed to make the wrong decision each time as if he's guessing rather than reacting.\n\n[Sixers 105 OKC 96](https://www.nba.com/stats/events?CFID=&amp;CFPARAMS=&amp;GameEventID=607&amp;GameID=0022300239&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;flag=1&amp;title=Reed%203PT%20Jump%20Shot%20(5%20PTS)%20(Beverley%204%20AST))\n\nNo idea what he's doing here. Comes over to double Maxey and commit to it by jumping for the pass. Wiggins has to cover both Beverly and Reed and bites on the pump fake as a result while Bertans is scrambling to get back leading to an advantage and a kick out. Even with this happening and teammates rotating well, Bertans is just lost afterwards leaving his cover wide open over the other side. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.5697}, {"ranking": 0.7068965517241379, "comments": "I love Mark Diagneault, but He calls his timeouts too late on the opposing teams runs.

I\u2019ve thought about the Giddey situation a lot and one word comes to mind: Disgusting. It\u2019s disgusting how this dude\u2019s name has been dragged through the mud by anonymous internet detectives looking to fill a void in their boring, pathetic lives. It\u2019s hard to grasp how quickly this story blew up and the extent to which many have run with it and labeled him terrible names like \u2018pedo.\u2019 The entire story has been guilty until proven innocent - a sign of the times we live in, but it\u2019s pathetic and dangerous. Shame on anyone that has taken part in the labeling and harassment of this guy based on internet gossip and rumor. \n\nTo think that all of this has happened to a (seemingly) GOOD dude. Giddey has done everything right since joining OKC - plays hard, works to improve and has been active in the community (charity, OU/OSU games, etc). Yes, he\u2019s struggled on the court at times, but he\u2019s only 21. Off the court, yes, there are terrible people out there who put a mask on and come across as \u2018nice\u2019 or likable - I don\u2019t know for a fact, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be Josh. Based on family, friend, and teammate feedback, he\u2019s a good guy with good intentions. \n\nYes, he\u2019s obviously a classic member of Gen Z that is a bit reckless with social media. When you allow people to put your name and face out there, especially as a young, rich, successful NBA player, you open yourself up to scrutiny. You live and you learn. Im sure he\u2019s learned A LOT already. \n\nI really hope this turns out to be a massive nothing burger and things return to normal. Giddey JUST TURNED 21 and has his entire life/career in front of him. Like the rest of the NBA, he parties, hooks up and enjoys a life that comes with fame, wealth and notoriety. Could he have made a mistake? Of course - people sneak into clubs all the time with fake IDs or lie about their age. People also get hammered (Giddey included). That said, I highly doubt this guy is out seeking underage girls or the type of predator that he\u2019s being made out to be. \n\nMoral to the story: Wait until the facts come out and don\u2019t play judge, jury, and executioner. Nobody knows how old anyone was, what actually went down, or even what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not.", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": 0.9848}, {"ranking": 0.7068965517241379, "comments": "Do the Thunder have a prominent female coach who sits on the bench?

Obviously, a team to some extent is ALWAYS in player development mode.   A team always wants its players to play a little bit better, get better at free throws etc.\n\nThe Thunder have been in \u201cmostly tank mode\u201d which I supported.   In fact, I think that they should have tanked a bit more shamelessly, lol, but I digress.\n\nI believe that the Thunder have started shifting to maximizing wins as opposed player development.    As evidence of that fact:\n\n1.   The bottom of the roster guys are, quite simply, not playing much (or at all).   Tre Mann and Poku are mostly decorations for the bench.\n\n2.   The team seems to be giving playing time (mostly) due to performance, with a few notable exceptions.  (Giddey still starts but his minutes in crunch time have been cut.).  Lindy Waters game is another notable exception.\n\n3.     I don\u2019t think that the team is in \u201cwin now mode\u201d and will be hell bent on bringing in a player to help stack wins (but maybe they SHOULD be considering it if the cost/benefit is right).\n\n4.    The team seems to be shortening its rotations to about 10 players and playing to win games with what we have.\n\n5.   If this were strictly a development year, I think Giddey would still be closing out games. \n\n6.    I think the days of \u201cit\u2019s ok if we suck because of whatever\u201d are over.\n\n7.    I can\u2019t figure out why the team would have Lindy Waters on the roster, unless it\u2019s just as a placeholder for a player that may be elevated at some point from the Blue or a player that we will trade for on down the road.\n\n8.

I wanted to try to quantify that, so I dove into the NBA.com \u201chustle\u201d stats. Let\u2019s get to it.\n\nFirst of all, what are the hustle stats and where do they come from? Several years ago, every single NBA arena had tracking cameras installed. These track every player, during every second of game play. When people reference stats like \u201cso and so shoots 40% on 3\u2019s with a defender 4-6 feet away\u201d \u2026that\u2019s the kind of data that comes from these cameras. They also can tell how far players run, how fast they accelerate etc. They also track\u2026. hustle stats. I just rarely see anyone reference them. NBA.com tracks about 10 different official stats in the hustle category. I\u2019ll link to it at the end so you can play around with the number for yourself. The main ones I focused on are deflections, loose balls recovered, charges and boxouts. The data is collected both at the player and team level. \n\n**Deflections**\n\nDallas averages 11.6 deflections per game. You\u2019re probably wondering \u201cis that a lot\u201d? In short, no. That\u2019s the second least in the NBA, ahead of only the Pistons. On the other end of the spectrum, Orlando and the Clippers average 17-18 deflections per game, they\u2019re both top 5 in team defensive rating. As I think about deflections, such a low number doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Dallas \u201cdoesn\u2019t hustle\u201d. This is also a measure of the general length and wingspan of a team\u2019s defense. See Orlando and LAC, teams stacked with rangy wing and forward types, guys who are obviously a little more prone at getting their hands on passes. As a point of interest, there is a moderate correlation between deflections and a lower team defensive rating. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2pimrzxjww2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a5b323f6a875b1016e97a88885c5967b3faf7280\n\nLooking at individual player deflections highlighted some interesting points. Keep in mind these are all per 36 minutes. I thought that would make the most sense or this would just largely reflect which guys play the most minutes. The graph is color coded to denote which quartile the player ranks in the entire league (I kept the \u201centire league\u201d to rotation players\u2026. very loosely defined. Basically, anyone who has played more than 75 minutes this season).  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5us1x6oww2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3c8109572259d969c9d7f2d61e28487332a69340\n\nCurry has always had the reputation as a pesky defensive player and his deflections certainly back that up. Anecdotally I\u2019ve felt like Luka has had active hands this year and again that shows up in the numbers. Good to see Kyrie fairly high up, as I do feel like he\u2019s battled and given great effort on D this year. Green and Powell feel about right too, both extremely active and energetic. \n\nGrant and Hardaway being so far below average feel significant to me, as they both account for a ton of important minutes. There are many ways to make an impact on defense, but one of the easiest is turnovers, deflections etc. and it just seems like Williams lacks the length and quickness to bother offenses in this regard. Kleber obviously jumps off the page in a bad way. Would be interesting to compare his numbers over the past couple of years\u2026.is he consistently this low or is this a reflection of his poor play and general physical deterioration this season?  \n\n**Loose Balls Recovered**\n\nLet\u2019s look at loose balls recovered. This is a stat that measures exactly what it says: \u201cthe number of times a team gains sole possession of a live ball that is not in the control of either team\u201d. Dallas checks in with 6.4 per game\u2026. which ranks 4th in the league. Like deflections, I think this stat measures a bit of a combination of true \u201chustle\u201d and just the wingspan and length of a team. Looking through the entire league the numbers generally move in the direction that you would assume\u2026. more loose balls collected = better defense. Until Houston. They have the #1 defensive rating in the league\u2026and the least number of loose balls collected in the entire league by a wide margin. See the graph below. They\u2019re the X in the upper left-hand corner all by themselves. Their number is so far out of the norm that I wonder if there is some issue with the data, or the cameras. If you include all 30 teams, there is 0 correlation between loose balls recovered and defensive rating. I eliminated Houston and ran the analysis for the hell of it and it did end up being very similar to deflections\u2026moderate correlation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2i6i1aauww2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1ca393cc85c3ca4fbd989531e67becb009579fdb\n\nSee below for the Mavs individual numbers on loose balls collected. I\u2019m a little bit unsure of how I feel about this stat\u2026.my gut says that this is more of a true \u201chustle\u201d stat. I feel like it does a pretty good job of calling out general effort and activity on defense. Diving into a pile to grab a contested ball, getting your nose dirty etc. I\u2019m curious what others think on this matter. I have a feeling that big men generally score low here, as being so tall makes you less liable to dive onto the floor. Just a theory, I\u2019ll have to do some additional digging into that at some point.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g8wjzbuxww2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d6c4f0521a248a2a5d859bc455241e874246295\n\nAgain, these are all per 36 minutes so playing time won\u2019t impact the numbers. Holmes, Exum and Green would be near the top of my list if you had me subjectively guess who \u201chustles\u201d the most on Dallas. I\u2019m really surprised that Powell checked in at the bottom of the team. Grant is near the bottom here as well but watching him I feel like he\u2019s giving maximal effort out there. Just something interesting to note, maybe more a reflection of his positioning within the defense or noise within the early goings of the season. Overall, this tells me that Dallas has quite a few guys who aren\u2019t afraid to get after it. That clearly isn\u2019t enough on defense, but it\u2019s a start. \n\n**Charges Drawn**\n\nThis one is also straightforward. How many charges does the team draw per game? Not to my surprise, Dallas ranks near the top of the league. Their figure of .94 charges drawn per game is good for #2 in the league behind only Thibs\u2019 rough and tumble Knicks squad.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ut1wbkl2xw2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=06143d75018d5254111d03c4541f717d531b5190\n\nStatistically speaking, there is no correlation between charges drawn and defensive rating (at least with this data set, eventually I\u2019d like to expand this analysis to prior seasons). To me, that tracks. Who is generally good at drawing charges? Players who aren\u2019t good at blocking shots. Players who are shorter and stockier, less athletic. It makes sense to me, that drawing charges is kind of the yin to the yang of athleticism and flying around on defense. Players who excel in one of those areas generally don\u2019t put in the time or effort to excel in the other area. Or they simply don\u2019t have the physical capabilities. Let\u2019s dive into the Dallas roster specifically. \n\n[  ](https://preview.redd.it/zsxm20g6xw2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d70d255b77be6d12e7924b0964c22d9d6cc9d580)\n\nThis graph looks a little goofy because of the relative lack of charges by nature\u2026.as you can see 6 players have yet to draw one this season. Unsurprisingly, Timmy Hardaway is one of the league leaders here. Small sample size but encouraging to see Hardy here. He\u2019s clearly going to be a mediocre defender at best so would be in his best interest to start to master this skill as early as possible. What would be more interesting would be to compare these charges drawn numbers to players considered to be top defenders throughout the league. Another project to add to the list. \n\n**Contested Shots**\n\nContested 2- and 3-point shots is also tracked on NBA.com. I analyzed that data and just frankly didn\u2019t come away with anything worthy of a longer writeup at this time. Basically, big men are all at the top of the scale for contesting 2 pointers, while the league leaders in 3 pointers contested were mostly on teams that simply allowed a bunch of 3\u2019s. I\u2019ll need to reevaluate and try to figure out some different ways to parse that info.\n\n**Boxouts**\n\nThere\u2019s quite a bit of data on NBA.com about boxouts. Let\u2019s start with how they define boxouts; \u201cThe number of times a player made physical contact with an opponent who was actively pursuing a rebound, showed visible progress or strong effort in disadvantaging the opponent, and successfully prevented that opponent from securing the rebound\u201d. My main focus for this analysis was on the defensive glass as essentially every scheme calls for strong boxing out on the defensive end. This should, in theory, be a decent measure of a team\u2019s overall effort.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v8v9424lxw2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5df79c129ab23e6662eeb58e6058d6908e802442\n\nThe Mavs, maybe to the surprise of no one, are left wanting. They are 22nd in the league in defensive box out % i.e.. they give up a lot of unimpeded looks for other teams on the offensive glass. This certainly aligns with my eyes during games. Let\u2019s look at the individual data because this is where things get super interesting. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jfs298h6dx2c1.png?width=975&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00462722474469bb40238f88c2867db2f329ec1c\n\nThe Dallas big men ***ALL*** jump off the page\u2026.in a very bad way. Powell and Grant are below average while Lively and Holmes are in the bottom quartile of the league. Of course, some context is needed. For a guy like Lively, I assume his boxout rate is going to suffer because he\u2019s such a shot blocking threat. It\u2019s simply not possible to do both at the same time. While Holmes is nowhere near Lively\u2019s level deterring shots at the rim, he\u2019s got a little something to him in that regard, so again, the numbers make sense. Powell and Grant are tough to reconcile, as neither has much ability to block or alter shots at all. Are both guys going for blocks when they have no chance and subsequently failing to box their man out? Are they simply losing track of their mark...or just not giving the required effort? If they\u2019re not boxing out and not providing resistance at the rim\u2026. where is their value add as bigs on defense? It\u2019s funny because my eyes tell me Grant is playing well on defense and I don\u2019t think these stats are necessarily saying he\u2019s a part of the problem. Just some interesting data points that suggest that he may be better suited to be a piece of a good defense, rather than the catalyst that turns around a terrible overall defense. \n\nAs an aside, you can see there are several Mavs with 100% box out rates. That's the cases on most teams. Have Luka and Kyrie really combined to miss 0 defensive box outs this entire season? I'm skeptical. The total number of box outs seems low to me as well. Kyrie is tagged as having 3 this season, while Luka has 14. These numbers track with other teams so it may just be that I need to get a more clear understanding of how they define a box out attempt. \n\n**Overview**\n\nI came into this exercise trying to ascertain if Dallas plays hard or not. Of course, I knew that would be tough to prove with just the numbers and frankly I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve drawn a strong conclusion in that regard. The deflections are an interesting data point that I hadn\u2019t seen analyzed, but to me that says more about the lack of length in the Mavs lineup rather than their disdain for hustle. The box out percentages were really the key takeaway for me here. Again, I\u2019m not sure that necessarily ties into Dallas\u2019 effort levels on defense, but I do think it unequivocally highlights a major weakness area that needs to be addressed on the defensive end. If anything, looking at the hustle stats have opened more questions than answers for me. I\u2019ve got a few threads I want to pull at, especially regarding taking a closer look at these stats and their correlations to strong team defensive ratings in previous seasons. Appreciate everyone who read all the way through, would love any feedback. \n\n[Box Out Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/box-outs?PerMode=Per36)\n\n[Hustle Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/hustle?PerMode=Per36)\n\n[Stats Glossary](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/glossary#deflections)\n\n\\*\\*All the stats above are current through 11/26/2023\\*\\*", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": 0.9994}, {"ranking": 0.5, "comments": "High chance Luka gets an Olympic-free summer next year Draw for the FIBA Olympic qualifying tournament has been announced, and Slovenia had no luck.

See below for previous looks at wings and bigs. But now it's time for guards. \n\n[Trade Targets: 4/5 edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/181qo8d/trade_targets_45_edition/)\n\n[Trade Targets: 3/4 edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1831rwo/trade_targets_34_edition/)  \n\n**Alex Caruso \u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** One of the best overall defensive guards in the league. Incredible defensive impact numbers in terms of plus/minus. Top of the charts block and steal numbers every single season in the NBA. His presence has a massive impact on shutting down opposing transition offense, but he\u2019s also an excellent offensive rebounder in his own right. Such a tough combo to pull off. Fantastic help defender and communicator from my eyes. His teams consistently excel in transition offense when he\u2019s on the court. Midrange was never a big part of his game but he\u2019s almost eliminated those shots in recent years, 80-85% of his shots are either at the rim or behind the arc now. Not a huge volume, but an excellent finisher at the rim. Draws a ton of fouls too. \n\n**Cons \u2013** Missed at least a decent chunk of time in basically every season with some sort of injury. Seems his intense style of play is just going to cause him to be unavailable for \\~20 games a year. Average as a defensive rebounder from the combo position. In Dallas would he be tasked with battling 3 men more often? Think that could be a weakness although to be fair to him it hasn\u2019t been thus far. Caruso is turnover prone, tries to fit some passes into windows that are too tight. Only attempts 5-6 shots a game (you could argue this is a pro on the Dallas roster), will he muck up spacing in crunch time if he\u2019s not willing to let it fly?\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** High. One of the most team friendly short-term contracts in the league. 9.5 this year and 10 next year that is only partially guaranteed. His defensive prowess paired with his ability to fit into almost any offense means basically every team in the league could use him. Expect a bidding war if and when he becomes available. \n\n**Overview \u2013** Played nearly 24 mins a game in the playoffs during the Lakers championship run as an A+ role player. Mavs would be looking for him to fill a similar role in their system. For my money, I think he would be almost a perfect fit for the Mav\u2019s current needs. POA and just overall defensive monster, who can do enough to warrant being guarded on offense. Added bonus is you get him for 1.5 years and then can sign him longer term, although he may be the sort of player who wears down quickly as he enters his 30\u2019s. While Caruso is bigger than McBride and Carter, the same general idea applies; how does he fit into a hypothetical Dallas playoff lineup? Luka and Kyrie are obviously set in stone, so does Caruso provide enough umph and strength on the glass or would the Mavs be better served utilizing their trade assets on a bigger wing? Caruso did come out of the Bulls most recent game after having his foot stepped on, didn\u2019t appear serious but you never know. \n\n**Miles McBride \u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Had the reputation as a Pat Beverely style defensive guard coming into the draft, and in limited minutes throughout his career the numbers largely back that up. Good hands, high number of steals. On/off splits for his career are fantastic overall, especially defensively. Seems to recognize his role (or lack thereof) on offense and spends much of his time spotting up for 3. A large share of his 3\u2019s are from the corner and has excelled from there (38% for his career\u2026only 68 attempts though). Plays hard and is great at getting back on defense, opposing transition offense numbers consistently fall off a cliff when he\u2019s on the court. Measured with a 6\u20198 wingspan at the combine. 23 years old and a restricted FA at the end of this season. Mavs would have a little trial period with him before deciding on keeping him around or not.\n\n**Cons \u2013** Other than corner 3\u2019s, appears to be a complete 0 on offense. Far below average from every other area on the court. Fouls like crazy (those Pat Beverely comparisons were pretty spot on). Has been a below average individual rebounder so far. Doesn\u2019t show much ability passing the ball, puts up miniscule assist numbers consistently. Listed at 6\u20191 195 so won\u2019t add anything to the Mavs in terms of bulk.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Low. Out of the Knicks rotation now and has never been able to get on solid footing with his playing time so far in NY. Could be a situation where the Knicks have decided they will likely move on from him at the end of the season and figure they might as well grab a 2nd round pick for him now. \n\n**Overview \u2013** What would his role even be on the Mavs? He would be taking minutes from Curry/Hardy? Even if you play McBride over one of those guys (I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a good idea but play along with me), that leaves him what, 8 minutes a game in the regular season? I just don\u2019t see any possibility at all that he\u2019s able to crack a playoff rotation. There\u2019s a chance he replicates Ntilikina and makes a big impact in a few games during the playoffs, chasing around a quick PG and causing chaos for a bit. But I think that slim upside isn\u2019t worth chasing. Mike Miles Jr. had a similar overall scouting report, and the Mavs gave him a decent look in camp, so I think this general archetype is something that intrigues the front office but they already have that guy developing in the G League. \n\n**Jevon Carter \u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Plays to his strengths of offense. 60-70% of his attempts come from deep and if anything he can be too quick to pull the trigger at time. Has settled in as a near 40% guy from 3 as he\u2019s gotten more consistent playing time the last few years and a fair number of those come off the dribble. Think he\u2019s a legit shooter and if anything could become more lethal if some of those became C&amp;S. He and McBride both went to WVU and both have been billed as strong POA defensive guards. Carter\u2019s numbers back this up as well. Great block and steal numbers consistently throughout his NBA time. He gets up tight on people and really battles them (again, reminds me of Pat Bev). \n\n**Cons \u2013** Year after year he fouls people like crazy. Very weak individual rebounding numbers. Horribly inefficient from everywhere on the court except 3. His teams offenses have reliably lost a ton of efficiency with him on the court over his career. Basically a play finisher, he\u2019s not had much success finding teammates for assists at any point. \n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Low? I\u2019m a broken record with the Bulls at this point, but it seems likely they\u2019ll start trading off everything that isn\u2019t tied down soon (they probably should anyway). Carter is on an excellent deal (about 6.5 this year and next, with a PO for 6.8 the following year). \n\n**Overview \u2013** Has gotten playing time with the Bucks in the playoffs the last 2 years but relegated to 10-12 minutes a game. Think his lack of size would essentially cap him at that number in Dallas as well. Same general thoughts here as I had with McBride; who is Carter taking minutes from? Because of his shooting ability I do think you could make a case for him stealing time from Curry/Hardy, but it\u2019s difficult for me to see any possibility of him playing serious minutes with the way Dallas\u2019 roster is currently constructed.  This would be a low upside trade although I think Carter could help with one of the Mavs biggest weaknesses being POA defense. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you read the 3/4 and 4/5 editions above, you'll notice that a ton of Bulls made the list. I think there's some intriguing combinations from the Chicago role players who could really make a noticeable impact on Dallas in the short and long term future. For me, I'd be all over trying to pry Caruso + Pat Williams from Chicago. Caruso is obviously major help in the here and now, addressing one of, if not the, number weakness for Dallas with his outstanding POA defense. Williams *should* be able to carve out 15-20 minutes a game as a defensive wing (again, a huge weakness for Dallas) and assuming things go ok he can then be brought back on a longer term deal and groomed to be his own version of DFS. \n\nThat all sounds great, but what would you have to give up to get them? Incredibly difficult to say. I've read/heard the expected going price for Caruso is going to be two first round picks. Hardy + filler + 2 lightly protected picks for both Caruso and Williams? The trade gurus will have to chip in here but I believe the Mavs do have access to trading 2 future first round picks. Maybe Hardy + Green and one pick? I do think Dallas should try to hang onto Green if at all possible, but of course you have to give up value to get value. They could include OMax as a substitute for one of the picks or Green etc....just not sure how much value he holds. \n\nCurious what folks think. Am I just completely off on my perceived value of adding Caruso? Would he vault Dallas into a tier worthy of contending with Denver etc? I think Dallas has a nice little window here for the next 2 years, with Kyrie and Luka, their offense should continue to be elite so if they can find a way to even an average defense that gives them a fighting chance.", "date": "20231126", "sentiment": 0.9983}, {"ranking": 0.5, "comments": "Game Thread: Dallas Mavericks (10-5) at LA Clippers (6-8) Nov 25 2023 9:30 PM #Dallas Mavericks at LA Clippers\n\nCrypto.com Arena- Los Angeles, CA\n\n[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584872)\n\n[TV/Radio](https://reddit.com/r/Mavericks/comments/1840c7f/game_thread_dallas_mavericks_105_at_la_clippers/kas8wlb/)\n\n\n\n***\n\n|Time Clock|\n|:--:|\n|Final|\n\n||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|DAL |18|27|17|26|88|\n|LAC |29|27|23|28|107|\n\n###On the court\n\n**Dallas Mavericks**\n\n|Player|MINS|PTS|FGM-A|3PM-A|FTM-A|ORB|DRB|REB|AST|STL|BLK|TO|PF|+/-|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|R.

On a great, descending contract for this year and 2 more, fully guaranteed. Gets off 5+ from behind the arc a game, at about 36% for his career. Pretty nice assist numbers for his entire career. Usually has above average block and steal figures, coupled with a low foul rate. 6\u20197 with 7\u20193 wingspan. Significant decrease in opponent attempts at the rim when he\u2019s on the court. Coincidence, or is his presence deterring opponents?\n\n**Cons \u2013** Bad to very bad efficiency from everywhere except 3 point range. Awful individual and team rebounding numbers for every single season. Not quite athletic enough to get to the rim, settles for a lot of tough shots in the 4-10 foot range. Doesn\u2019t draw fouls at all. \n\n**Price Tag \u2013** High. Young, fulltime starter on a great contract. I think he would cost the Mavs multiple firsts if they want to pursue him. \n\n**Overview \u2013** His most efficient season by a mile was 21-22, when he trimmed his usage rate, slashed his attempts from the midrange and upped his 3 pointers significantly. Could be the blueprint for his role with the Mavs. Hard to get over these awful rebounding numbers. I think he\u2019s in a similar situation to Grant Williams, plays 4 and occasionally smallball 5. I see his true position (and Grant\u2019s) as a 3.5. Could PJ take the starting 3 spot with the Mavs current configuration or will that simply be yet one more defender who can\u2019t keep his man in front of him?\n\n**Patrick Williams \u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Shooting upside. Low volume (2 attempts per game) but 40% in his career from 3. 78% from the line as well. Currently shoots way too often from the long mid range, eliminating those should be pretty easy low hanging fruit to up his efficiency. Individual steal, block and foul rates are all very strong every year. Looks the part of a strong, athletic wing. Individual rebound numbers are weak but team excels with him on the court on the defensive glass. 6\u20197 with a 6\u201911 wingspan would provide some much needed length.  \n\n**Cons \u2013** Deeply negative on/off numbers on both sides of the ball consistently throughout his entire career. Borderline passive on offense. Hesitates to let it fly. Struggles massively on 2 pointers. Terrible assist and turnover rates. Doesn\u2019t draw fouls or put the defense in compromising positions very often. May have lost his confidence.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Moderate? The current regime drafted him but there\u2019s at least a chance the Bulls clean house in the near future. Brand new front office may be likely to move on from previous high picks they have no ties to, not to mention the fact that Williams has massively disappointed anyway. \n\n**Overview \u2013** 22 years old, former 4th overall pick. Final year of his rookie deal. A move for Williams intrigues me because of the Mavs salary cap situation. If (big if) he fit in well with the Mavs, they would control his bird rights and should be able to get him under contract at a reasonable rate for 3-4 years. Mavs tried a similar style deal with Doug McDermott years ago and just decided to let him walk at the end of their trial run. All depends on the price tag, but if the Bulls are willing to move off Williams for relatively little, I think this is a potential nice way for the Mavs to get bring another young guy into the fold. \n\n**Jerami Grant \u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Long, athletic wing with strong defensive reputation. Blocks a ton of shots and manages to not foul too. Draws a bunch of fouls on the offensive end and knocks down FT\u2019s at a high clip. Has turned himself into a consistent 3 point threat. Similar to Williams, takes way too many long mid rang shots although he hits them at a high percentage. Shift those to 3\u2019s and he should see a nice boost efficiency wise. Made significant strides with his passing in the last 3-4 years and is someone I consider a solid ball mover at this point. Under contract for several more years (see below).\n\n**Cons \u2013** Generally positive impact on team defense, but pretty scatter shot, has had seasons where his presence was a big negative. No big impact on team rebounding. Big question for me is his acceptance of a role change. Was previously a 3&amp;D rebounder etc with Denver and left in free agency for the chance to have more of the offense run through him. Does he still feel that way? High usage for 4 straight years and there might be an adjustment period for him relearning to take a backseat in Dallas. Under contract for several more years\u2026.lol.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** This is a tough one. On one hand he was traded to Portland and signed a massive deal with them under the pretense of being a role player on a Dame led squad, on the other hand that is obviously no longer the case. My gut says Portland would be willing to move off him (and his contract) for a relatively modest price, maybe J Green, filler and a future 1st.  \n\n**Overview \u2013** On paper he presents a pretty great option, at least in the short term. Nearly 30, the tail end of his current deal could be rough and really hinder the Mavs. Trading for Grant would require some intel on his goals and willingness to go back to a 3&amp;D role as this would largely tie up the cap for the next 2-3 years. Personally, this feels like an all in move and I don\u2019t think it would make the Mavs true title contenders. \n\n**OG Anunoby \u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Elite size for a 2 way 3&amp;D wing. Extremely strong and well built. 70-80% of his shots come either at the rim or behind the arc. Consistent 38%+ from deep. Excellent at the rim as well. Individual block and steal rates are upper level year after year. Really gets after it on the offensive glass too. Upper echelon on/off splits for both sides of the ball. Also a major driving force in the offensive transition game. Seems to be in the right place at the right time always on defense. 26 years old.\n\n**Cons \u2013** Low assist rate coupled with high turnovers. Much more of a play finisher rather than someone who can facilitate much offense on his own. Mediocre individual defensive rebound numbers. 18.6 million this year and then a player option that is likely to be turned down. Will be looking for major raise on his next deal.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Very high. Young, plug and play type wing who can fit into any system. Number of teams who can use him is essentially everyone. Major bidding war would ensue for OG.\n\n**Overview \u2013** Looks to be the perfect fit for Dallas as a top end role player. Think he would slot into the 3 spot seamlessly and shore up the defense while knocking down open shots on offense. Young enough that he would be major part of the team for his entire next contract. Same idea as Siakam, Mavs would have to take a bit of risk as he is only guaranteed for the rest of this season. No promise that he sticks around after that, but Dallas would have his full bird rights. Rumor is that Memphis offered 4 first round picks for him last year\u2026. does Dallas even have enough ammo for him? \n\n**Dorian Finney-Smith -** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Obviously well known to the Mavs so I\u2019ll keep this writeup a little shorter. Battle tested gritty defender. Versatile and capable of switching. Long, strong, still athletic as he nears 31 years old. Quintessential low usage 3&amp;D player. Comfortable spotting up around Luka pick and roles. Especially excels from the corners, which is huge for the Mavs offense. A+ offensive rebounder during his Mavs tenure.\n\n**Cons \u2013** Is nearing the age where athletic wings can lose a step and take them from a major positive to completely mediocre on defense. Not a real passing threat, pretty much just a play finisher. Small sample size but his rim finishing numbers have fallen off a cliff since moving to the Nets. Fluke, or start of athletic deterioration? \n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Nets are off to a slow start and they\u2019re a bit tough to nail down. DFS has played well, but I don\u2019t think Brooklyn is wed to him beyond this contract and may be intrigued at the prospect of taking on some more future Mavs draft capital. Feels similar to the Grant package, Green/Hardy + a 1st. \n\n**Overview \u2013** Only guaranteed for this year and next (15.4 player option in 25-26 that I would guess he\u2019ll turn down) so this is actually a likely a 1.5 year rental. That should keep the price tag fairly modest. Reacquiring DFS probably isn\u2019t the highest ceiling play, but the fit couldn\u2019t be better and that makes this feel like a super safe way to improve the team\u2019s main areas of weakness.  \n\n**Pascal Siakam -**\n\n**Pros \u2013** High usage wing. Huge, HUGE positive on/off numbers both offensively and defensively for his entire career. Ditto for defensive rebounding. Off the charts positive impact on transition offense. Assist rate has steadily improved over his career, all the while his turnover rate has been inching downward. Really tough combo to pull off. Manages not to foul at a high clip as well. 6\u20199 with a 7\u20193 wingspan and has experience at the 3,4 and 5 in his career. Would be a huge boost to the Mavs just strictly for his size. Puts the defense in compromised situations all the time, draws fouls consistently. 2018/2019 season (Raptors championship year) was by far his most efficient offensive season. Is that because he\u2019s more suited to playing second fiddle behind a superstar (Luka/Kawhi), or is that shooting luck/fluke? \n\n**Cons \u2013** Inefficient scorer from the field. Career 32% from deep is way below average in today\u2019s NBA. Shot profile is a throwback. Top of the charts for number of attempts from the long mid-range. I\u2019m nit picking here but he\u2019s nearly 30, and not much of a jump shooter so his drop off could be steeper/faster than most. Free agent at the end of this season and is surely looking to get paid big money. \n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Very high. Would be a major bidding war for him. Multiple firsts + young players. Mavs may not even have enough to get him if they wanted to.\n\n**Overview \u2013** Majority of his shots are unassisted, so there may be some untapped potential if he could transform a lot of those to catch and shoot in Dallas playing off Kyrie and Luka. Is he interested in shifting his role from offensive hub to role player? There was chatter about him being traded last year and even word that he was telling teams behind the scenes that he wouldn\u2019t sign an extension with anyone except Toronto. Then there was also rumors of a dispute between Siakam and Raptors management\u2026.hard to know what is going on with that situation. Mavs would have to get their intel straight and have a great idea as to what Siakam is looking for in free agency. Same situation as Kyrie last year\u2026..they would hold his full bird rights but obviously that\u2019s no guarantee. Probably the highest ceiling option on my list, but clearly there is quite a bit of risk as there is a possibility he\u2019s just a rental.  \n\n**Deni Avdija -** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Same situation (and draft class) as Patrick Williams. Restricted free agent this upcoming offseason and acquiring him would allow the Mavs to have a nice little trial period before committing long term. Really strong on/off splits for a Wizards team that has been a trainwreck for most of his time there. Positive transition impact numbers over his career, an area that I\u2019m sure the Mavs will look to continue to emphasize. Gets to the rim a shocking amount of time (to me anyway). Above average finisher once he gets there. Makes some really nice passes. Good steal figures and outstanding defensive rebounding numbers, both individually and on a team level.\n\n**Cons \u2013** Had the rep as a potential good shooter coming into the draft, but has been really poor from 3 thus far (to be fair so far this year he\u2019s been excellent in a small sample). Short arms (6\u20198 with an identical wingspan). Fairly turnover prone. Number of 3 pointers is trending in the wrong direction for a role player. Could be a result of the Wizards being a mess and Deni taking on more of a creator role than he would be in Dallas. Inefficient offensive player for all of his career until this season. Fouls way too often.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** High? With Wizards in total rebuild it\u2019s tough to see why they would punt on a 22 year old former lottery pick unless they were either blown away with the offer, or totally out on Deni. They\u2019re playing him 27 minutes a game, so by all accounts they haven\u2019t given up on him. \n\n**Overview \u2013** Same general idea as Patrick Williams. Would really be an interesting way for the Mavs to bring in a young player who could fit with their core for the long term. After doing a deep dive on Deni, I came away far more impressed than I expected to be. I think if you could shift the shot profile he would fit really nicely with this current Mavs core. I love the + rebounding numbers. Question for me is the upside. Does trading a big package for him boost the Mavs into contention? \n\n**Torrey Craig \u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Extremely low usage 3&amp;D player. Knows his role, attempts vast majority of his shots from 3 or at the rim. Really strong block rates, no listed wingspan but certainly plays like it\u2019s a big +. Excellent individual offensive and defensive rebound rates. One of the best in the league at getting offensive boards after free throws. 2.5 million this year with a 2.8 player option for next.\n\n**Cons \u2013** Horrific on/off impact stats for his entire career. Truly bottom of the scale. Inefficient shooter from everywhere except at the rim. Fouls at an extremely high rate. Team rebounding number with him on the court are pretty consistently awful. 33 years old.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Low (free). Bulls will likely shift to total rebuild soon. Very likely (imo) that Craig is moved for whatever they can get, or just bought out.  \n\n**Overview \u2013** Would basically be this years version of Justin Holiday. Flier on a defensive wing with low probability of making an impact. No upside at all.\n\n**Ish Wainright \u2013** \n\n\\*\\*\\*Sprained MCL. Currently out 4-6 weeks.\n\n**Pros \u2013** Stocky, muscular forward. Extremely physical. Knows his role on offense, hangs out in the corners and pretty much only shots from behind the arc. Strong individual steal and block rates. Limited playing time in the NBA so small sample size, but positive impact on both sides of the ball on/off wise. Huge positive differential for team rebounding both offensively and defensively. \n\n**Cons \u2013** Basically has never been efficient from anywhere on the floor during his time in the NBA. Stands behind the 3 point line, but doesn\u2019t actually have any gravity out there. Play finisher only, not really a passer at all. Pretty slow footed, can he really stay in front of most wing players or is he more of a 4 man defensively? \n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Low. Blazers essentially tanking this year. Would think they would be willing to move Wainright for whatever they can get. Would actually be a restricted FA at the end of this season, spent time in Europe after college so that could change the calculus on his value a little bit. \n\n**Overview \u2013** I\u2019ll call him kind of the rich man\u2019s version of Craig. 0 offensively, but I\u2019m a touch intrigued by the rebounding numbers, obviously an area of huge weakness for the Mavs. With Jones Jr. at the 3 spot Dallas have gone with a limited offensive player, who can play some POA defense and gives them general athleticism. Wainright would be a kind of inverse version of that, at least defensively. Still mostly a non factor on offense, but brings some added bulk and toughness to a defense that could use it. Can playing with Luka and Kyrie juice Wainrights offense (as has been the case so far with Jones Jr.)? If they get a hidden gem they would be able to presumably keep him under contract at a bargain rate for a few years. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTakeaways:  \n\n\nQuite a few interesting options IMO. Some really high impact (and high cost) guys, as well as some bargain bin types. The cop out answer for who they should target is \"it depends on the price and the players willingness to re-sign\" ete.  \n\n\nThe cap gurus will have to chip in for a more in depth analysis on future tax/second apron implications here but if the Mavs can pry OG or Pascal from Toronto, I think that move alone could bump the defense up a notch without hurting the offense at all (likely will even help the offense slightly). Of course a trade of that magnitude will cost most of all of the Mavs remaining assets, so this would qualify as an all in move. Would adding either of those guys put Dallas in a position to outlast Denver/Boston etc in the playoffs?   \n\n\nThe safer and longer term plays are PJ, Pat Williams and Deni. All could help now and also be a part of the long term future at a much more reasonable cap number. Would allow the Mavs to retain some tax/apron flexibility. DFS fits into this category as well although he's of course older and we pretty much know what to expect from him on the court in the Dallas ecosystem.  \n\n\nGrant is kind of between the two groups....higher risk with his massive long term cap hit, but I'm not sure the upside is there to push Dallas into true contention.   \n\n\nCraig and Wainright are more of the discount pickup guys. Obviously not going to make a huge difference come playoff time but could chip in during the regular season.   \n\n\nWould love to know what folks think from this group above, or if there are some other names who I didn't highlight.

Been playing around with a ton of data lately and wanted to put it to use to try to draw up some feasible acquisition targets that could shore up the Mavs. This ended up being far more work than I anticipated, so only the 4/5 men coming out tonight. More to come assuming people are interested.\n\nWithout further ado.\n\n**Andre Drummond \u2013**\n\n**Offensive Role \u2013** Garbage man. Offensive rebounder extraordinaire. Not really a vertical threat. 0 spacing provided, only attempts shots within the paint. Puts up a fair amount of post ups. Consistently high usage rate\u2026.not someone who is content just watching on offense, for better or worse. Has had some spurts of nice passing years ago but those days seem to be behind him.\n\n**Defensive Role \u2013** Drop coverage big. Fantastic individual rebounder although impact on team defensive rebounding is mixed bag. Great hands, excellent steal rate. Obviously a big, physical presence in the paint although his rim deterrence numbers are mixed at best.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Low (possibly free later in the year)? In final year of contract making 3.3 million. Currently playing &lt;15 mins a game as backup 5. Bulls appear to be on precipice of total rebuild.\n\n**Overview \u2013** Previously linked to Mavs this past offseason. Seems to be some interest from both sides. Basically a stronger, less vertical version of Powell. Would strictly fill the role of backup big. No danger to Lively\u2019s playing time. Drummond would be an interesting add on for a bigger trade\u2026.don\u2019t think he\u2019s worth pursuing by himself unless it\u2019s on the buyout market.\n\n**Chris Boucher \u2013**\n\n**Offensive Role \u2013** Spacing big man who can dive to the rim as well. 80-90% of his shots come at the rim or from 3. He\u2019s really increased his frequency from the corners over the years and appears to be settling in nicely there. Jump shot release is slow. Attacks the offensive glass really well. Black hole, basically doesn\u2019t pass once he gets the ball. Think of him as a more extreme, more spry Kleber. Could play alongside Lively.\n\n**Defensive Role \u2013** Strong weakside shot blocker. Average individual defensive rebound numbers although team numbers reliably fall off when he\u2019s on the court. Frail build lets him get overpowered at times. Tweener who has trouble chasing quicker guys but isn't strong enough to battle with true bigs.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Moderate? Playing 15 mins a game in backup role. 22 million left fully guaranteed for this year and next. Older than you think (31 in January) as he didn\u2019t really get started until age 25. Just spitballing but something along the lines of Hardy straight up for him could make sense for both sides.\n\n**Overview \u2013** Raptors are in no mans land\u2026.middling roster, some strong young pieces and some guys who would be really nice role players are playoff teams. . I think Boucher would be a prime target if the injury news on Kleber is bleak, or if the Mavs just think he\u2019s cooked physically. Could slot into that role from day 1.\n\n**Mike Muscala \u2013**\n\n**Offensive Role \u2013** Spacing/spot up big man. 70% of his shots come from beyond the arc. Completely comfortable sitting in the corner and letting them fly. Recurring theme at this point but he\u2019s not much of a ball mover. Not a dive man at all. Slightly different players but again, think of a Kleber lite role on offense. Low usage, jump shooting 4 man.\n\n**Defensive Role \u2013** Fits the Powell mold generally speaking. In the right place, tries hard, just has minimal overall impact on defense. Not a shot blocker, doesn\u2019t generate steals. One positive is he doesn\u2019t foul much. Individual rebound numbers are very weak but his teams consistently clear the glass when he\u2019s on defense. Think he\u2019s a strong boxout guy although I don\u2019t have the numbers to back that up. Not going to improve the Mavs defense.\n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Low (possibly free later in the year)? Barely playing for a tanking Wizards team. Same story as Drummond, may be available for buyout in a few months.\n\n**Overview \u2013** Wizards have no real reason to keep him. Had really effective stretches with OKC the last few years and played well with Boston down the stretch last year. Couldn\u2019t crack the playoff rotation. He could be completely finished but based on last year think it\u2019s probably just a case of DC wanting to give minutes to younger guys for the future (ignore the fact that they\u2019re playing Gallinari 15 mins a game as a big). Similar to Boucher, I think Muscala could be a potential to fill in for Kleber if he has further physical deterioration.\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are of course a ton of other big men who could help the Mavs, but I tried to keep it to a list of players who would be reasonably available. Mavs aren't getting Rudy Gobert for example. I didn't do a full writeup on him because I doubt he's on the market, but **Paul Reed** is another target. Not a 3 point shooter so difficult/impossible to play with Lively, but could take backup 5 minutes. Outstanding block and steal guy and also crushes the offensive glass but would be an unorthodox move for Philly to move someone like that.\n\nI'll come out with my list for wings in the coming days. Some names in my analysis really surprised me and I'm curious what you guys' reactions will be. With the Mavs offense as potent as it is, I think they really need to be turning the screws to try to make this defense as competent as possible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEdit\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHad someone mention Gafford so I went back and dug into him. Had one more interesting name pop up so did a writeup on him as well. See below.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n  \n\n**Kelly Olynyk -** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Inside/outside big man with a proven decade long track record of highly efficient offense. Major weapon from deep, excellent gravity. Methodical driving game. Draws help and willing passer. In the Kleber mold (on offense), kind of a 4.5. Pretty nice activity with his hands, able to rack up steals consistently. \n\n**Cons \u2013** Sometimes too willing as a passer. Trying to fit the ball into tight windows, resulting in a high turnover rate. Negative wingspan (6\u201911, listed 6\u201910 wingspan) that really shows up when you watch him. Eerily similar to Powell, in the right place with his arms up but just provides no resistance at the rim. Awful foul and rebound rates. \n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Low? If the Jazz decide to sell I would think Olynyk would be one of the easiest pieces to trade off. Expiring contract at 12.2 for this year. Has heavy ties to Ainge dating back to his Boston days so there may be some sort of backroom agreement that he will either keep KO or trade him to a destination with his approval. Then again, Ainge is cutthroat, so he\u2019d probably have 0 issues dealing KO to the highest bidder.\n\n**Overview \u2013** Really is a blending of Powell on defense and Kleber on offense (for better or worse). Pushing 33 years old. Likely just a rental. Think he only makes sense as an option if injuries hit the Mavs front court. \n\n**Daniel Gafford\u2013** \n\n**Pros \u2013** Major threat as a pick and roll dive man. Outstanding finishing around the basket. Dunks everything\u2026..extremely violently more often than not. Knows his limitations and has yet to attempt a 3 in his career. Almost 100% of his shots are within a few feet of the hoop. Excellent offensive rebounder too. Draws a good amount of fouls, usually battling for offensive boards. Top of the scale block rates every single year. Related: opponents\u2019 accuracy at the rim falls off a cliff when he\u2019s on the court, his presence makes a significant statistical difference. \n\n**Cons \u2013** Has very little value as a short roll man or playmaker. Awful assist and turnover rates every season. Is jumpy on defense. Bites on pump fakes and fouls a bunch. He\u2019s so good at blocking shots that he goes for anything and everything (think JaVale McGhee or Hassan Whiteside). His personal defensive rebound rate is just sort of bad, but the team numbers with him on the court are consistently horrific. Opposing centers routinely get several easy putbacks per game when Gafford is busy going for a block he has no chance on.  \n\n**Price Tag \u2013** Moderate? At 25 years old, he\u2019s the only young center on the Wizards roster. Has 2 years and 27 mil left on his deal after this season. Clearly they aren\u2019t trying to win, but they also have to have some semblance of a roster to complete the season. \n\n**Overview \u2013** Gafford has some notable positives (and negatives). As a player, I can see a case for him being basically an upgraded version of Powell/Holmes, but from an asset management point of view, what is a 5% upgrade at backup center really worth? Moving Holmes + a 2nd for Gafford is going to get you what\u2026.an extra half a win this season? IMO, Gafford is not worth the assets and cap space that he would require.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter further evaluation, for better or worse, I think the Mavs best play of attack is to roll with Lively. He's definitely shown enough that you don't want to bring in a starting caliber Center to take away minutes from him and as such, leaves you hunting for backup center types who are going to be relegated to 10-15 minutes per game. Dallas already has 2 of those on the roster. Unless something major changes, the play for me is to simply continue starting Lively and mix and match Powell/Holmes as the backup 5. I'd especially try to find some opportunities for Holmes to get a little run. Has many of the same flaws as Powell in regards to rebounding, but Holmes does have a little shot blocking ability, which has been on display during the 2 LA games.

If both players shoot the league averages of .361 for the 3 point player and .548 for the 2 point player, after 10 shots each the 3 point shooter will have 12 points and the 2 point player 10.\n\nHowever...the real world doesn't work quite that way. While the league only shoots .548 on 2's, the FG% at the rim is .691.

For it's strengths, on average the 3 is still the lowest percentage shot in the game.\n\nWe've seen the analytical outcome of the value of 3 point shooting in the warriors run. Maybe we are now seeing the analytical adjustment to that, if a team is going to try and beat you with the 3 you push the pace and beat them at the rim. Our offensive sets make us extremely susceptible to this as we park 2 players in the corners and a missed 3 typically creates a long rebound. So the chance of a 2 on 1 or 3 on 2 is extremely high. This situation gets compounded if the Mavs are down and they lean even heavier into 3 point shooting to try and catch up.\n\nWhat it boils down to...if the Mavs want to be successful shooting the 3 at the rate we are, they've got to have a transition defense strong enough to handle the \\~60% of those possessions when we miss. Doesn't have to be elite, just fast/effective enough to not allow a fast break score at the rim.", "date": "20231120", "sentiment": 0.744}, {"ranking": 0.5, "comments": "Genius.

According to [basketball reference's league shooting page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2024_shooting.html) Matisse ranks first among qualified players in 2 point percentage, at 13/15, or 86.7%.\n\nHOWEVER, when reviewing the footage of each of his attempts, I noticed something strange.

It is a long season, but if they want to win a championship, they need to start working together better to capitalize on the fear and panic the other creates in a defense.*\n\n*Link for video links showing two-man actions:*\n\n[*https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp/p/light-years-ahead?r=2wmouo&amp;utm\\_campaign=post&amp;utm\\_medium=web*](https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp/p/light-years-ahead?r=2wmouo&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web)\n\nThe difference between the NBA\u2019s reigning most potent two-man game of Steph Curry and Draymond Green (CG) and their up-and-coming counterparts Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo (LA). It\u2019s simply a matter of Collective Thinking Power, and the CG combo has that in spades. They have played an astounding 40,588 Regular Season and Playoff possessions together and produced four championships. Compare that to LA\u2019s anemic 788 Regular Season possessions and *zero* Playoff possessions. There is nothing like an extra *forty thousand* possessions to enhance the Collective Thinking Power of two of the world\u2019s most creative, intelligent, and talented players.\n\n**Panic Thinking &amp; Two-Man Game Optionality - -**\n\nDuring a broadcast years ago, the legendary Coach Hubie Brown said, \u201cYou set screens to make defenders think. Great shooters make defenders panic thinkers, and when you panic, you make mistakes.\u201d Creating one moment of Panic Thinking (PT) for defenders every possession will lead to great offense.\n\nPT moments happen in two-man games when defenders are forced via screen or cut to make a quick decision to help, not help, or switch.\n\nThe more optionality the action creates, the more opportunities defenders have to produce a PT moment. Once a PT moment happens, it becomes an exercise of making simple reads for the offense: shoot or pass.\n\nCurry and Green do a masterful job of synthesizing their Collective Thinking Power into moments of pure panic for defenders.\n\n**Twelve Notes Then The Octave Repeats - -**\n\nThe three most common on-ball two-man games run in basketball are the pick-and-roll (PnR), dribble handoff (DHO), and Get action. If you have never heard of a Get action, it\u2019s pretty simple: you throw the ball to a teammate and then immediately follow it. The first layer of possible options players can produce in these actions are strikingly similar.\n\n*(List represents base options based on coverages: Switch, Touch-&gt; Drop, or Deep Drop)*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The non-screening player uses the screen.\n\n\\*Options - Shoot, Drive, or Pass to the screener (roll or pop).\n\n2. The non-screening player goes away from the screen, a.k .a. refusal.\n\n\\*Options - Shoot, Drive, or Pass to the screener (roll or pop).\n\n3. The screening player keeps the ball in DHO or Get.\n\n\\*Options - Shoot, Drive or Pass\n\nWash, rinse, and repeat. All three actions have essentially the same basic options. These two-man games are the basketball equivalent of how Jackson Maine saw music. Twelve notes, and then the octave repeats; it\u2019s the same story told over and over. The general structure and options are always the same, but what makes a combination unique is how the players see those twelve notes.\n\nOf all the two-man games, the PnR has the most simple communication for defenders because it moves the slowest. It also has the lowest turnover risk because only the most skilled ball-hander of the two dribbles the ball. All five defenders have the opportunity to see the ball and man clearly.\n\nThe DHO creates more complications for defenders and can move much quicker than the PnR. Because the screener has the ball, the offensive player using the screen can move at a much higher rate of speed and ferocity to set up their attack angle into the screen. The inversion of the ball handler also takes away the opportunity for all five defenders to see the ball and man clearly. Finally, the DHO offers a golden opportunity the PnR does not: A catch-and-shoot three-point shot during the initial screening action. Catch-and-shoot threes are the holy grail for an NBA offense.\n\nBut by far, the most complicated action for defenders to navigate is the Get action. It supercharges all the speed, ferocity, and optionality of the DHO. Every possible option in the previous actions is available here, but with one massive difference: the screener has *not* used a *live* dribble. Any sniff of early help from the screener\u2019s man can be punished with an immediate dribble drive into a 4v3 attack. This extra layer of optionality of the Get action makes it the ultimate two-man game.\n\nEvery player must operate within these twelve notes. The great ones can see the space as a blank canvas of endless opportunities to create magic within.\n\n**Curry &amp; Green vs.** **Lillard &amp; Antetokounmpo - -**\n\nOver the years, the Varsity squad has figured out one crucial piece to the puzzle that still alludes their JV counterparts. This critical detail has become the lynchpin of their two-man game's creativity and success. Handoff opportunities at the point of inflection, like the ones in DHO and Get actions, are significantly greater than their live-dribble counterparts in the PnR.\n\nAccording to Second Spectrum, Lillard has run 10.4 PnRs per game and only 1.6 handoffs. Curry has run 8.0 PnRs per game and 2.5 handoffs. Curry also obliterates opposing defenders in these actions, scoring at an astounding 1.74 Points Per Possession (PPP) compared to 0.76 PPP in PnR actions. Meanwhile, Lillard sits at a respectable 1.25 PPP in handoffs and 1.00 PPP in PnR actions. Throughout an 82-game season, Curry is on track to score two hundred and twenty-two more points from handoffs than Lillard. Factor in all the buckets teammates score from the PT moments Curry creates in these handoffs, and you are talking about thousands more points per season.\n\nThe most significant *fear* factor the DHO and Get Action have over the PnR is its option for a C&amp;S or one-dribble three-point shot opportunity. These shots are the creme de la creme opportunities for elite shooters like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard, and the fear of giving up one of these opportunities sends defenders panic thinking into overdrive!\n\nCurry is taking 6.1 zero dribble threes a game and shooting a blistering 54.1% on those shots. He\u2019s also getting up 1.1 one-dribble threes a game and shooting a casual 60.0% on those attempts. That\u2019s a ridiculous 1.625 PPP. If that doesn\u2019t make you panic as a defense about giving him one of those shots, then someone needs to check your pulse.\n\nThe CG two-man game consistently keeps defenders off balance by creating these catch-and-shoot moments. They are challenging shots to get, especially when you are the best shooter on the planet. They are only possible because of the selflessness of both players operating within their two-man games. They work hard to set up intelligent cuts that enhance the other's skill set, creating endless optionality and moments of panic thinking for defenders.\n\nMy college coach, Roy Williams, used to have a \u201cthought of the day\u201d before every practice. On the first practice of every year, it was always the same: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what can be accomplished when no one cares who gets the credit.\u201d This quote perfectly embodies the CG two-man game.\n\nThe good news is that Lillard and Antetokounmpo have opportunities to shift their diet from less efficient play types like ISO\u2019s to more efficient ones like handoffs. Should they be turning more PnRs into Handoffs? Yes. But there is even lower-hanging fruit they can get to first.\n\nThe Varsity squad would *never* pass up on opportunities like the ones above to run a two-man action. They know that together, they create significantly more panic than alone.\n\nBut there might be hope for the JV. Recently, they have put handoff actions on tape that feature hints of creativity and optionality. Making you wonder if they are starting to understand they can play the twelve notes together and not just as the solo artists they have been all their careers. Or was it just a mirage born out of necessity? And not genuine cohesive creativity like the Varsity squad displays so often with the effortless ease of a Slash guitar solo.\n\nCG\u2019s two-man game has 40,558 possessions of Collective Thinking Power, a number that dwarfs any other current two-man game in the NBA, which they consistently use to create panic-thinking moments.

It honestly might just be that simple.\n\nLillard is often referred to as the second-best shooter behind Curry, and he might be, but the gap is vast (link). Over his twelve seasons in the league, Lillard\u2019s season high for made threes is 275 in 2020/21, and he has shot over 40% from three-point range just once, hitting 270 threes at 40.1% in 2019/20.\n\nMeanwhile, the walking supernova known to the world as Steph Curry has topped the 275-made threes mark six times in his fifteen seasons. Maxing out at an NBA record 402 made threes in 2015/16. Somehow, more impressively, is the fact that he has only shot below 40% from three-point range ONCE in his fifteen-year career, on shooting volume unknown to any other human walking the planet!\n\nPut that level of shooting together with the 40,558 possessions of Collective Think Power, endless creativity, and both players\u2019 genuine egolessness, and it\u2019s easy to see why the Curry and Green two-man game is still *light-years ahead.*", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.9992}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "Doomers in the game threads be like ", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.3612}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "2023-2024 Milwaukee Bucks in the Clutch Our team is 4th in total number of games coming down to the clutch with 10 (game within 5, 5 minutes left in 4th quarter/OT).\n\nIn the clutch our offensive rating jumps from an already amazing 118.4 (4th in the league) to an unbelievable 135.4 (1st among teams in the clutch).\n\nThe team tightens up defensively as well, going from 115.5 (21st best) normally to 95.8 (3rd best in the clutch).\n\nNot too bad for a team with 2 regressing superstars and a bad coach right?  \n \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.9231}, {"ranking": 0.7931034482758621, "comments": "5 man Lineup Data Not sure if anyone's posted/discussed our best 5 man lineups so far (Cut off at a minimum of 15 minutes played to eliminate the smallest samples:\n\nThe starting 5 (BroLo, Khris, GA, Dame, Malik)- 116.7 ORtg, 104.5 DRtg in 115 minutes\n\nBroLo, Pat, GA, Dame, Malik- 123.0 ORtg, 102.5 DRtg in 51 mins\n\nBroLo, Bobby, Dame, Pat, Malik- 119.2 ORtg, 97.5 DRtg in 33 mins\n\nGA, Cam, Bobby, Pat, MarJon- 135.3 ORtg, 113.5 DRtg in 24 mins\n\nGA, Cam, Bobby, Pat, Green- 150.0 ORtg, 121.9 DRtg in 15 mins\n\nNow to the Net negative lineups:\n\nBrolo, Dame, Jae, GA, Malik- 100.0 ORtg, 106.8 DRtg in 44 mins\n\nDame, GA, Bobby, Pat, MarJon- 101.8 ORtg, 102 DRtg in 24 mins\n\nKhris, GA, Cam, Bobby, Pat- 121.4 ORtg, 143.2 DRtg in 22 mins\n\nBroLo, Dame, GA, Beasley, AJax- 90.9 ORtg, 140.0 DRtg in 20 mins\n\nBroLo, Dame, Jae, Pat, Malik- 81.8 ORtg, 150.0 DRtg in 15 mins\n\nThoughts?

With that being said I wanted to make a post asking when/what you all think the turning point of the Bucks being a luxury tax paying, championship contending team.\n\nFor me, I think it was the decision not to resign Jabari Parker for a crazy high salary. Some people liked him and thought it was a mistake, and that he was worth it and we would be a worse team without him. I was just reminiscing about him, and looked up that he's out of the league now. I think it shows how great of a decision it was to pass on that contract. I think Horst and the front office deserve a lot of credit for tough decisions like these, and what they prioritize. They look for multli talented and great value players, not one dimensional hype. They also know when to move on from promising and productive players (brogdon, divincenzo, bledsoe, holiday, Allen, to name a few). So what I'm saying is the turning point was having an aggressive front office that isn't afraid of making tough decisions and take risks in order to try to get more value, starting with the decision to spend Jabari extension money elsewhere, and continuing on trades that incrementally improved the roster. I'm just imagining another Greg Monroe (maybe it was someone else) contract scenario where we keep paying for someone not even on the roster. I think it would've been possible with injury prone and out of the NBA Jabari Parker (not to hate on him). And hence the focus of getting higher quality players and not settling/overpaying for what the \"Bucks' market quality of player\" was expected. They are no longer satisfied with first-round playoff type players, but strive to get championship quality players.\n\nJust curious on others thoughts and if the turning point to them was earlier.

I\u2019ve been engaging in the game threads for the first time this season, and I (like many others) often fall victim to the epic highs and lows of Bucks basketball. I\u2019ve watched every game so far this season, and I\u2019d like to share my thoughts and ask some questions to hear what you guys think.\n\nI\u2019ll start by acknowledging that our record is quite impressive. While we\u2019ve struggled a lot during games, the team has managed to pull through more often than not. That said, I feel like we\u2019re fighting for our lives every single game. Just once I\u2019d like to watch the bucks blow a team out of the water so we can get some of those sweet, sweet T Nasty fourth quarter minutes. IMO, our defense is lacking in both personnel and schemes. We\u2019re not seeing enough rookie minutes, even though those guys seem to shore up our defense. We also don\u2019t have much to give come the trade deadline. I\u2019ve heard many people call for AG to be fired (I\u2019ve done it a few times myself), I\u2019ve heard people say we need more defensive-minded players, I\u2019ve heard some say we just need time to figure out our identity. Personally I think losing Jae Crowder was devastating, so I\u2019m going to try and save my judgments until he\u2019s back in action. This probably explains the statistical underperformance of the bench in the last two games, which has made games a lot closer than they would otherwise be. \n\nIn your opinion, what needs to be done to fix some of the most obvious issues the team faces? Why haven\u2019t we seen some seemingly obvious plays from AG like the Dame + Giannis PnR or more minutes for our rookies? What trades can reasonably be made to improve the team? Do you think we\u2019ve improved much since the start of the season?  At what point should we be concerned with the team\u2019s performance? \n\nI want the team to succeed, but I have yet to walk away feeling confident about a win. I have hope that things will improve, but the doomer in me says if we don\u2019t act fast, we won\u2019t be able to find something that works in time for the playoffs. I think Tuesday\u2019s game against the Heat will be a good measure of progress.

We Clippers fans have spent the last year and a half trying to figure out who to blame for our steady demise. It's Lawrence Frank. It's Marcus Morris. It's Ty Lue. It's PG. It's Zu. It's the lack of a backup center. It's...you get the point. There is no lack of blame being thrown around, and now it is being tossed at the new low hanging fruit: Harden.\n\nWell, it's probably a little bit of all of that; however, I cannot get past one simple issue that has been true no matter who was on the roster or in the starting lineup over the last two years. That is, if a team wants to beat the Clippers, they simply have to agree to play hard for four quarters. That's it. Play hard. I wrote in the game chat at the start of the Nuggets game that \"hungry teams are our kryptonite.\" And it is largely true, and definitely not anything new, as we saw this play out over the course of last year.\n\nThe Clippers have the second highest paid lineup in the NBA. They also have four guaranteed future HOFers. On paper, you would ask who the Clippers might end up playing in the WCF because that series is inevitable.  However, it's not. In fact, it's borderline laughable to think this team could make it there. But why??? Well, I will tell you...\n\nThis team has zero leadership and might be, at this point, full on anti-leadership. When you are an NBA veteran and can no longer figure out how to get up for games, you have no leadership. When you are a young NBA player and cannot figure out how to get up for games, nobody is teaching you. After watching the 213 era for years, I can no longer see any leadership or guess who it might come from. Ty Lue has looked checked out and I think that has to do with his lack of control of the roster. Paul George is admittedly not a strong leader. He is a nice guy and homie to most in the NBA, but he has never been known for leadership. The same is quite apparent with Kawhi. After years and years of watching Kawhi, it's hard for anyone to convince me that Kawhi is a leader on and off the court. Those three people are your top guys on the squad and I don't get ANY leadership vibes from any of them. I think they are all three very talented folks in their own right, but no longer see any leadership.\n\nWe have also moved on from guys like PatBev and Batum that, although secondary players, had those leadership type of skills both on and off the court. We have not replaced them with similar guys. As for Russ and James, they are still so new. Russ is the type of leader we need, but he can only do so much as the 3rd or 4th guy playing a clear backup role. James is so new that he doesn't even look like he is comfortable to shoot an open shot. No matter how kind and gentle and sweet he is to his teammates, Harden also gives off vibes of \"I will play when I play on my own terms.\" For better or worse, it is what it is.\n\nBottom Line: This team does not consistently play hard. This team does not respond well to being punched in the face. This team, again, looks absolutely disinterested in the regular season, months after declaring the regular season is important. Teams with 4 future HOFers that are not completely washed should NEVER lose a game like they did to Denver. Never. There is zero excuse. If they play hard, they win going away. It's inexcusable and the only thing I could think is that nobody was stepping up to change the energy. Change the attitude. Change ANYTHING about that putrid performance. I'm not worried about the talent level of the team, how washed certain stars are, or if Zu sucks or not. I'm worried we have a team that is just showing up, collecting checks, and relying on \"talent\" to beat everyone. Well, if that is the formula, we are done. The NBA is way too good to just show up and beat people. I think we learned that two nights ago. The only way this changes is if someone steps up and leads, changes the attitude, and plays like an old school Clipper.

There is no off ball movement. This kills the pace and rhythm. Off the bench Harden can play his dribble God style and get his buckets that way. He also is a low energy player even on defense.

But these things really do take time. Look at Rudy on the Wolves- that trade was reviled at the team. People were sure Kyrie would blow up the Mavs. Trades involving stars always bring a lot of squawking, but it\u2019s crickets a few months later when the wins pile up.\n\n2. If this team doesn\u2019t get better, they have awesome trade value. You really think Miami wouldn\u2019t make the same or better offer for Kawhi that they made for Dame? You think the Lakers wouldn\u2019t break open the piggy bank for PG? If we\u2019re not in a different place by mid-January when the bird rights clear, they\u2019re not gonna sit still. \n\n3. This team\u2019s problems are mostly mental. I went into last night worried we\u2019d lose. Why? Because this team has too many leaders who look at an injury report and think they can coast. This team has a burnt out coach and play dumb. These things can get fixed a lot easier than a talent deficit. \n\nAnyhow, that\u2019s all I got at this (very) low point.

We have a good enough squad to make 2 strong units.

Harden playing as a playmaker and assist the team is the best option. Remember that he lead the league in assists last year. TMann playing next to harden and covering for both on defense should be enough. If PG and The klaw manage to stay healthy all season, they should be able to do the job on both ends. And giving Zu confidence and him getting his shit together would do the job at the fifth spot. Having 3 different Centers on the team and many different top scorers should be enough. Even wb Powell bones tucker theis/Plumlee should be enough for the second unit.\n\nAnd finding the right 5 to close with depending on who you are playing against has to be easy when you have so much to choose from. \n\nOnly thing making us losing games is the coaching staff.

But Jokic was 1 year and a half older than Topic currently is.**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**ACHIEVEMENTS:**\n\n**- U18 FIBA Euro Champion and MVP this summer.**\n\n\\- MVP of the most prestigious Euroleague Youth Tournament (Adidas NGT).\n\nWith a huge performance: **49 points, 12 Assists, 11 Fouls Drawn, 20/20 FT, and a historic PIR of 65, in a 21-point come-back win.**\n\nFor the tournament, Topic averaged 26.8 points (52.9% 3Pts), 32/33 FT (97.0%), 3.8 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 2.0 steals, and 6.2 fouls drawn for a PIR average of 33.5.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n\n\\- Offensively, this guy has a huge potential: **He currently leads his league in Points and Assists (2 teams in his league also play in the Euroleague). Can score, can pass, can hold the ball, can run an offense at a high level.**\n\n\\- Offensively, he low-key reminds me of a young Parker with some flashes of a young Luka (and I'm careful with my words), although they have different profiles and contexts, obviously. Luka was in a league of his own.\n\n\\- **FINISHING is very good.** Can finish at the rim in many different situations. The bag is very versatile. Can drive to the basket against giant big Serbians with ease and at will. He can finish with both hands and has no problem being physical on the offense.\n\n\\- Drives a lot to the Basket. 71% of his shots are made in the paint (baby Tony Parker).\n\n\\- **HANDLING**: Comfortable and solid. With both hands.\n\n\\- **VISION/IQ/INSTINCTS are one of the highest in his draft class**. Understands and controls pace and rhythm. Good decision-making. Good feel for the game. Does that against seasoned veterans.\n\n\\- **HIS PASSING SKILLS ARE ELITE.** Makes some incredible reads and no-look passes all the time, with both hands. Can laser pass off the dribble with either hand. Sees the entire court well, plays with his head high, and makes great reads.\n\n\\- **PICK AND ROLLs** are a good part of his game, he plays very well with his bigs.\n\n\\- **He does not have a beautiful shot yet but reports say it's not very hard to fix, has decent efficiency at the 3pt line** (37% last season, 31% this season, on 4.5 attempts/game over 12 games, and can shoot from NBA range). His shoot is already honest enough now, that he can develop it into something teams have to plan against and adjust to.\n\n\\-He does not seem \"flashy with an ego\". Hard to find interviews with him. But he looks low-key, discreet, and humble. Gets the job done, does not \"bark\" and keeps his mouth shut.\n\n\\- Shoots 3's off the dribble at a better efficiency.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- **Defensively, he's bad. He honestly tries most of the time. But sometimes he looks too tired or careless to try. To be fair, he's young, and a lot of him is demanded offensively, so it sometimes feels like he uses the defensive part as a way to rest).**\n\n\\- His mid-range floater isn't developed enough. It's often \"Finish at the Rim\", \"Pass/Pick'n Roll\", or \"3 Pt-Shot\".\n\n\\- His catch-and-shoot 3 is lacking in efficiency compared to off-dribble, scouts say it's probably because of footwork and mechanics.\n\n\\- TOV isn't the lowest out there (3 Turnovers/Game), but he still has a 2/1 Assist-to-turnover Ratio at his young age. So nothing alarming.\n\n\\- Some say his effective size seems smaller than 6ft6 (tall neck and big head). He has a giant 7ft wingspan for his size to make up for it though, and is young, so he could still be growing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**CURRENT** **STATS (small sample size, but coherent with last season):**\n\n12 games, in the ABA League:\n\n32 Minutes  \n18.50 Points (51%/31%/86%) - League Leader.  \n6.4 Assists - League Leader.  \n3.6 Rebounds  \n1.3 Steals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**WARNING:**\n\nI heard somebody say his current contract prevents him from joining the NBA directly next season. haven't found more sources on that yet. Just a random Youtube comment.\n\nBut I don't know if it's true, non-negociable, or a deal breaker for the Spurs.\n\nI don't know how good he is in English, and how well he will adapt to the cultural shift. But his father has a history of playing in multiple countries in Europe, with different languages and alphabets, so maybe that will help.\n\n\n**PS: Other great propsects I'd be happy with for the PG position, so far:** \n\n**- Stephon Castle (6ft6 selfless and confident Combo Guard who can shoot and is better at the defensive end).**\n\n**- Carlton Carrington (6ft5 surprise PG, early to tell, but very good so far).**", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9982}, {"ranking": 0.034482758620689655, "comments": "Sochan with some questionable taste\u2026lmaooo from Mamu\u2019s IG story", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": -0.296}, {"ranking": 0.034482758620689655, "comments": "NBA Vlogger explains why Spurs fans should still trust in Coach Popovich What yalls take?

I can actually see him knocking down some big buckets for us in the 2025/26 playoffs and setting the tone off the bench with his toughness. But to make this thing work, he's got to exit the starting lineup. I've seen too many missed lob dunks, layups, fumbled passes, missed wide open threes. It's time to make the change. \n\nSecondly, Cade needs to be slotted into the dbook role, so he can cook and take advantage of his full offensive game. He looked great cutting to the basket, hitting spot up threes, knocking down middy's of the screen etc. When he's asked to bring the ball up the floor consistently, face double teams, make passes and do this heliocentric thing, it simply is too much to ask at this point of his development. Yes, development...because Cade like our other youngins should be allowed time to develop. I'm not saying take the point guard responsibility away from him completely, because he is a gifted passer, but I'm thinking more 60/40 -2 guard to point guard ratio. \n\nAdd in some spacing for Beef Stew and then add Bogey coming back and I believe we'll look a lot better in short order.

He is still a little too \" handsy\" and gets called for the \"ticky-tack\" fouls, but that's on the officiating more than it is on him honestly trying to play good defense.

The Boston Celtics need to love the rim\n\nThis may be the most important niche number of the season: 30.4%. That is the share of Boston's shots that have come within the restricted area -- eighth-lowest in the league, per Cleaning The Glass. It is about identical to their number last season.\nBoston also ranks below average (19th) in free throw rate; they were 28th last season.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with being a jump-shooting team when you take and make the right jump shots. Boston leads the league in 3-point attempts and takes the second-fewest mid-rangers. That's healthy, though Boston's 3s tilt more above the break. All eight of Boston's core rotation players are above-average 3-point shooters. No team has better spacing. The middle of the floor is wide open.\nOne intended payoff of all that open territory is the ability to attack it without any defenders in your way. The Celtics are at their best when they remember the rim and the foul line are still the most reliable sources of offense -- immune from the cruel vicissitudes of shooting luck. They become vulnerable when they forget that -- when they fall in love with hero-ball jumpers.\n\nThere is no need for major recalibration. Boston should rank in the top-3 in 3s. But on some nights against elite defenses -- or when the 3s go cold -- exchanging four or five jumpers for assaults on the basket can be the difference between winning and losing. Driving to kick it out should not be the default option every time one of Boston's perimeter players hits the paint. If a corridor is there, seize it, even if it's narrow. It's OK to get a little grimy -- to seek contact.\n\n\n\n[Source](https://www.espn.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/39014974/zach-lowe-warriors-guard-playing-more-orlando-unsung-heroes)\n\n\n------\n\n\nThoughts?", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.8366}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "It would be so fucking funny if we drafted Bronny He\u2019s not expected to go first round so we don\u2019t even need a high draft pick but this would be hilarious.

Sue me. I\u2019m actually kind of glad I did, because I didn\u2019t have to do the obligatory \u201coverreact to the Hornets game\u201d column, though that game did make me feel good about having been a tentative wet blanket about the Celtics\u2019 blistering start. Regardless, the team has stabilized now, rendering that game a distant memory. Three of the four games since have been relatively smooth sailing, and injuries to Kristpas Porzingis and Jrue Holiday have left little impact on their fortunes. This is the advantage of having such a great top six; injuries are much easier to shrug off for a couple weeks. Obviously injuries would still be a big problem in the postseason, but as far as the 82 game slog known as the regular season goes, they\u2019re fine.\n\nThere is, of course, still some room for concern. A team with Boston\u2019s recent history should be concerned with the playoffs above all, especially in this era where the regular season seems to hardly matter. The idea that depth doesnt win in the playoffs is an overblown one in my opinion (look at how many options the Warriors had in the 2022 Finals when Jordan Poole, a key part of their rotation, became difficult to play) but the adage is true in this sense: Your top end talent, which is very important in the regular season, is absolutely critical in the chase for the cup. As people are wont to bring up, you don\u2019t win titles in the NBA without a top 5 player. And this is why I feel justified in continually harping on Jayson Tatum.\n\nAfter one quarter, the in-season tournament game against the Magic looked like another day at the office for the Celtics. They were already up double digits against a pretty offensively challenged team (missing their starting center, I might add), and a 4-0 group play record seemed all but assured. Enter Jonathan Issac. \n\nOrlando Magic coach Jamahl Mosley was a merciful ruler; he chose not to match Issac\u2019s minutes with Tatum\u2019s, allowing him a much needed respite, but the damage was already done. Boston was never the same after Issac guarded Tatum about as perfectly and as nastily as you could possibly draw up. Issac is not the first athletic wing to do this to him (Andrew Wiggins and Anthiny Edwards say, \u2018hi!\u2019) but he so thoroughly swallowed up every move Tatum made that it felt miraculous that Tatum actually did get some space to shoot out of a high screen. \n\nAllow me to take a paragraph to depart from Celtics talk and just gush about Jonathan Issac for a minute. I kinda loved him in the 2019-20 season when I was convinced he should be taken much more seriously as an all-defense candidate, and he looks even better now. Even if you aren\u2019t much of a defense guy, it should be striking to anyone watching how fluidly Issac is able to flap those pteranodon wings, poking around for steals like a six-foot-three guard might. Watching him defend LeBron early in the season was eye-opening: even at this advanced age, it\u2019s rare for a defender to be able to legitimately trade blows with him. It\u2019s amazing given some of the off-court happenings that have developed with him in the past couple of years, but he is fas becoming one of my guys. Anyways. \n\nThis is why I am so thoroughly fixated on Tatum learning go-to moves in the post. The true best players in the NBA are defense-proof, and Tatum isn\u2019t yet. And until he is, I don\u2019t care about the regular season record and the offensive efficiency. They can\u2019t beat Denver. \n\nI am not going too deep on the team this week, as I plan to cover the knockout round of the in-season tournament blow by blow over the next week, but keep an eye on Jaylen Brown\u2019s gunning and the offense they run when Tatum is on the bench. I will probably be talking about that stuff over the next couple of weeks, and hopefully not because they cost Boston an IST game.\n\nAnd now for the triumphant return of America\u2019s favorite segment, the Boston Celtics ambush play of the week! Because this team has a habit of turning opposing scorers into prey. Since I didn\u2019t do one last week, I\u2019ll give it to the double strip of Brook Lopez by Jrue Holiday and Al Horford. For some reason, maybe because it already seemed like the Celtics were going to win the game and that the chasm in defensive abilities was the reason for this, but that play just felt to me like a swarm that the Bucks could not escape. It\u2019s with 5:03 left in the fourth quarter, if you care to watch it. If you\u2019re using NBA.com, it is credited as a block for Al Horford.\n\nThis week, however, it won\u2019t be Horford winning it, despite some monster stock games vs. Atlanta and Chicago. I also won\u2019t be giving it to Luke Kornet, despite a monster stuffed dunk to cap off a three-block night against the Bulls.

One thing I will say though is that in general games are getting weird to watch as a whole. The game has become one where the goal is to run an offense that generates the best possible 3 pt shot. When the shots are falling it looks amazing but when they are not or even when they are just going through an average run (36%) it just is not very entertaining.\n\n\"The league-wide 3-point rate (the percentage of all field goal attempts that have come from beyond the arc) has increased in each of the last 10 seasons, rising from 22.2% in 2010-11 to 39.2% last season. And it's increased more in the last five years than it did in the previous five. \" - cited in 2021\n\nAs a huge 90s NBA I am not disillusioned to the fact that todays players are \"better\" than ever but I would argue the product or \"entertainment value\" is not. There are other factors involved for sure but every year it feels like more and more the 3 is prevalent. In 2008 we shot 17 a game and just 16 years later we are up to 43 a night!\n\nGuess this isnt as much a Celtics post as it is an NBA one but was curious to see how others felt about the correlation between entertainment value and the drastic increase in 3 pt shots a game.\n\n", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9871}, {"ranking": 0.7758620689655172, "comments": "Post Game Thread: The Boston Celtics defeat The Chicago Bulls 124-97 #Chicago Bulls at Boston Celtics\n\nTD Garden- Boston, MA\n\n[ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/401584141)\n\n[TV/Radio](https://reddit.com/r/bostonceltics/comments/186ad7d/game_thread_chicago_bulls_513_at_boston_celtics/kb6rv4c/)\n\n\n\n***\n\n|Time Clock|\n|:--:|\n|Final|\n\n||Q1|Q2|Q3|Q4|Total|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|CHI |20|30|18|29|97|\n|BOS |31|38|28|27|124|\n\n###Player Stats\n\n**Chicago Bulls**\n\n|Player|MINS|PTS|FGM-A|3PM-A|FTM-A|ORB|DRB|REB|AST|STL|BLK|TO|PF|+/-|\n|:--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|\n|D.

This is a good alternative to MSG, sans a few problems here and there, but it shouldn't be much of an issue.\n\n**Let's start with the Center****:**  \n***Price*** \\- For near-front row seats that are not VIP/Qatar level, **this cost me about $205 USD, totaling \\~$250 with taxes + fees.** This is an amazing price I feel for seats are so close to the players and the court compared to MSG, which is about 5x that price for that distance and view.\n\n***Perks*** \\- Here's the great part of why that price was so good; you get **unlimited food and drinks (non-alcoholic) for the entire duration of the game**. That is from start to finish. You are given a voucher that you can use on every concession restaurant. It doesn't matter how many times you want to eat, you will get it. You are allotted one entree, one drink and one dessert every visit. You want more? Come and get it on your next run-around. They are only one flight of stairs away as well!  \nIf you're feeling super lazy or just want to get smashed, you are given a personal QR code on your seat, where you can order some snacks and alcoholic drinks straight to your location. These are expensive, about $15USD per bottle for the lowest beer or hard liquor. You can definitely tell who are the rich guys in the section cause only rich old dudes were ordering it. Non-stop.\n\n***Food!*** \\- As you can see, I got the popular chicken fingers to start. But I also ate a sandwich and some pizza. Few things to note, however - 1) These are loaded with calories to make you full. They don't want you eating nonstop, so all these foods are meant to bloat you. I wanted 4 meals this entire game, but by the 3rd, I was already dying.  \nFried chicken is extremely popular for a reason. It's pretty good! By halftime, you will find yourself in an extremely long line for them.  \nAs someone who is in the NYC area, the pizza is not NY/NJ level. Not even close. It sucks. You're better off getting pizza fresh at the start, because the pizza at halftime can be a jawbreaker. My crown tooth felt the brunt of it before I gave up and ate the cheese.  \nBottled water is free with your front-row seat, but they will take the caps. Apparently people keep throwing them, so your bottle is always open. The seats have cup holders, but they will not hold bottles, so you're holding an open water bottle the whole time. Just go for diet soda or something.  \nThe bars around the arena are fantastic. You should definitely take a trip sometime, possibly at the beginning, because they fill up fast as the game goes on.\n\n***Seating Experience*** \\- The seats are comfortable, but if you're a big guy or have a big coat, you will have trouble. You won't be able to share arm rests with anyone, so make sure to assert dominance and take one of the two, or either fold your arms like a dad, or clash those hands together like a kid who's in trouble with the principle. Or, you can assume gaming position. I went for the latter. I was locked in.  \nAmazing view. You can see everything, but the whistle on the other side is impossible to hear. I didn't hear it once. It was awesome to see Matty D in person, though!  \nYou're an arm's length away from restrooms and restaurants even when you're so far down. Great access to a lot of things. It's worth every penny.  \nIt's **HOT** in this arena. The temp went up by 10 degrees (F) real quick. If there was any AC in this arena, it wasn't on. I was sweating just by sitting there.\n\n***Traveling*** \\- It's not as easy to get here as MSG, as you're going to be taking an extra train, usually a much older MTA train at that, which is constantly full from start to finish. Wait times can be brutal, especially if you miss a train.  \n\"Should I drive?\" No.  \n\"But what if I got a rental and-\" No. Any NY'er will tell you how dumb it is to bring a car to any arena. There's no parking, and the cheapest one is $35-50 flat and you STILL have to walk. Stop it. Don't kid yourself into thinking it's convenient. It's not. New York City wasn't made for convenience. That's why New Yorkers are always rough around the edges. Expect delays. **All the time.**  \nAnd for god's sake, if you can help it, don't use buses. Use the trains. Yeah, it's dank and sometimes weirdly hot down there, and the seats are a 50/50 in terms of sanitation, but trust me, you'll be fine.\n\n\\-\n\nWith that being said, enough of that. Let's talk about the team up close and my experience!:  \n\\- These mfers are HUGE. When the Brooklynettes went to dance, they were like tiny people compared to them.  \n\\- Masai and Bobby's extremely oiled up hair were here! They showed up minutes before tip-off. Bobby's hair was so shiny the reflection of the light off of it blinded me for a moment.  \n\\- Shootaround was the best indication that these dudes weren't gonna do well shooting from 3. They all missed. And I don't mean they missed because the balls were hitting each other at the rim. They were bricking. Every. Single. One of them. Felt like a precursor.  \n\\- Scottie was the only dude who struck a pose when his name was called for the starting lineup. The kids love him, too. They were screaming for him, even the kids who were Nets fans. Maybe his twitch stream was more popular than I thought.  \n\\- Precious.EXE stopped functioning the second the Brooklynettes came to dance. I mean, stopped. He held the ball during shootaround and went into a trance. He was pretending to not look, but this mfer looked. He could not actually function. He just straight froze, even when Pyro was going off for the Nets starting five, then glance at them, then freeze. Then glance. He had to shake his head to wake his ass up and try to focus on shooting instead of the Brooklyn Girls. He swished the first three. Then never shot again. I think Scottie had to snap him back to reality.  \n\\- Speaking of Precious... yeah. If you think it's frustrating seeing him on TV, wait till you see this dude up close and personal. **It's an experience.** I legit watched him butter-finger slip the ball on 3 straight possessions on 3 great passes before I think I spazzed out. It's almost impossible the way he fumbles the ball. It's like his hand-eye coordination is so off, or his brain lags. It was bad. It was really, really bad. And it sucks because I like him a lot, but you can tell that for all his physical gifts, his awareness of the moment is not there at all.  \n\\- But this isn't just his problem. He might be the worst example, but I noted that the team is constructed of physically, extremely gifted long athlete wings that seemed to have used Equivalent Exchange to use their BBIQ for more length and athleticism. A lot of them make bone-head mistakes, and they make it often.   \n\\- Nurse's princeton offense with DHOs makes a ton of sense now, because these dudes have issues making split decisions. They are incapable of thinking on the fly. It's why Darko wants to the 0.5 offense a lot, because he doesn't want them thinking too much, otherwise they'll freeze.  \n\\- I made a note to put a picture on this post of the bench, particularly this one. Because it shows why Masai chose these veterans over other prospects. Otto, Thad and Garrett were active the entire game. All three of them were talking together to the rest of the team in the TO before Darko makes his plays, trying to give very sound and solid advice. They're amazing teammates for sure! But there's a problem with this. I'll get to it soon.  \n\\- I can't even express how much support Schroder was giving. He was clapping and trying to will them during TOs and always redirecting everyone to pay attention to the play. Super positive, always trying to lift the team. It was awesome to see. A great PG. But there's a problem with this, too. More on that soon.  \n\\- Scottie didn't look like himself. He wasn't screaming when the Nets were attempting a shot, and he wasn't super aggressive in the paint. He was looking for fouls. I hated it. But at the same time, his volleyball pass to Boucher, and that other quick no-look relay pass to the paint shocked the whole crowd. They were shook. His vision and timing is immaculate.   \n\\- Darko made a note to grab the boys when they were heading to the bench to talk to them, and was super smiley and uplifting to all of them. But...  \n\\- The young guns get discouraged fast. And this is where the last few notes come to play because... **maybe Bev was right.** These kids are **soft**. I can't describe it well, but Masai constructed the vet presence and coaching to be as supportive as possible, to the point of coddling. I'm not saying Nurse's strict coaching was good for them either, but being all smiles and vibes really shows how fragile it is when the other team gets aggressive and starts talking that good shit. The young ones get shook. Garret made a note to talk to Precious after a TO to try and uplift him, but he looked out of it. It didn't seem like he listened.  \n\\- That's not to say all of them were not listening. Supporting vets and coaching works, but there has to be a balance. The ones who really benefitted were Malachi, Gary and.... McDaniels? During the TOs, Malachi was constantly locked in and listening. No fooling around, no slouched shoulders. Nothing. Gary never claps or says anything, but I realized he was always listening. He was paying attention. When the vets said something, he took every word in. It was great to see.  \n\\- Speaking of Gary, man some of his shots wowed the crowd. I'm so glad his shots are falling.  \n\\- Jalen was completely in his head, but he kept trying to listen to the vets. You can see he's struggling to improve and that he really cares about it. When he makes a wrong play, he gets REAL upset about it to the point that one of the vets or Darko has to calm him down.  \n\\- Also caught him falling asleep standing. He yawned... then just... passed out. Kind of amazing, really.  \n\\- Lastly, I needed to see it to believe it, but now I believe it. OG's legs are otherworldly huge. I mean actual tree trunks. I mean as thick as Jak's waist. I can't even describe it well. No one else's legs, NO ONE'S, came even close to the definition and appearance of pure strength than OG's. A goddamn horse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n...and that's about it. I didn't intent to type so much, but wow. I enjoyed my first time at Barclays so much. I would **100% recommend it, especially paying for lower section seats.** They are worth every penny!

I can't help but feel a stark contrast to the joy I experienced with last year's team. Instead of witnessing a cohesive unit, it felt like I was watching a flock of sheep donning lion masks. The lack of chemistry was glaring, defensive matchups were a disaster, and the reluctance to take charge, especially when Scottie has demonstrated the capability, was infuriating.\n\nLet's be clear, this isn't an isolated issue with one player; it's systemic. It's high time to hit the reset button and start afresh. The disheartening reality is that we seem to be regressing into a season reminiscent of our darkest days. We're out there playing a version of basketball that can only be described as positionless, with players seemingly clueless about their roles and how to execute them. It's mind-boggling that individuals earning hefty paychecks can be so passive on the court.\n\nIf this were a conventional workplace, and in essence, it is a professional setting, stern warnings about the need for heightened production and focus would be in order. We'd be talking about potential changes in staff to shake things up. It's like seeing a cut that needs immediate attention before it festers into an infection.\n\nI get that this might sound raw, but as a devoted fan, I can't hide my disappointment. I'm reaching a point where I'd rather go back to watching CJ Miles throwing bricks or DeMarre Carroll struggling but still hustling because, at least, they showed effort. Tonight, facing the Suns, are we in for a spanking? It's highly probable, although we tend to elevate our game against tougher opponents. Perhaps this is the moment when the guys will finally show up.\n\nBut let's be real, it might be time to embrace the tank. Bobby Webster, your time might be up, and maybe it's time to trade the whole roster, with the exception of Scottie, who should permanently assume the role of the second option. Let's not even mention Max; his unwillingness to take over and be 'the guy' is getting old.\n\nAs frustrated as I am, I can't help but rally the cry\u2014LET'S GO RAPTORS!?

Outsider here, but I'm a Celtics fan so between Ainge/Hardy/Olynyk I've been following the Jazz somewhat closely during the rebuild. I love a lot of what the Jazz have done so far, but I have been somewhat puzzled by Dunn's role on this team. \n\n\n\n\nAfter putting together a pretty great stretch at the end of last season, Dunn has been relegated to the 6th guard role, behind George/Clarkson/THT/Sexton/Agbaji. I of course understand wanting to get young guys minutes on this team, especially George and Agbaji. But why exactly has Dunn been kicked so far down the depth chart? If anything, I would have guessed that Hardy would play him more in the front half of the season to see if they could get any assets back for him at the deadline, though I have read stories of him being a great vet presence. He has played great next to George and from things George has said, Dunn seems to be a real veteran leader to him.\n\n\n\n\nI guess my question is whether or not you expect Dunn to crack back into the rotation for your team this season? Will one of the 5 guys ahead of him get moved, or do we expect things to continue like this? I can think of a few teams that would benefit from a backup PG like Dunn, so it feels like the Jazz could go many different directions from here. \n\n\n\n\n\nI appreciate any discussion in advance!", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9963}, {"ranking": 0.15517241379310345, "comments": "City concepts Since my last concept got so much hate I decided to alter it slightly and make another one.

Some perspective *Originally posted this on the r/NBA sub because I had issues posting here yesterday:*\n\nAs a Grizzlies fan looking forward to the upcoming 2024-25 season, I have seen a couple comments over in r/NBA that pose the question \"What other team would do any better with 7 of their rotation out\" and luckily for you, I am here to answer it (or at least make you think about it).   \n \n\n\nFirst, the context. For those of you who have been lucky enough to not catch a Grizzlies game, you may not be aware that currently, the team is playing with 6 key pieces of their rotation and Jake LaRavia out. To keep this as fair as possible, I have used the extremely reliable and smart minds at 2K games to assign each players ranking based on their [overall](https://www.2kratings.com/). Now arguably, you could deem some players more \"important\" to the team than their in game overall may consider, but I'll be honest this took long enough as it is so I will purposely ignore those opinions. \n\n\n**Grizzlies Injury Report** \n\nBrandon Clarke - PF/C, no timeline for return (Achilles), 77 OVR (6th best player)    \nSteven Adams - C, no timeline for return (Knee), 80 OVR (5th best player)  \nMarcus Smart - PG/SG, 3-5 weeks (Ankle), 82 OVR (4th best player)   \nLuke Kennard - SG/SF, re-evaluated in 2 weeks (Knee), 75 OVR (9th best player, not counting Jaylen Nowell - who is higher for some reason - as he's on a 10 day and it doesn't fit my agenda)  \nXavier Tillman - C/PF, week to week (knee), 76 OVR (7th best player)  \nJake LaRavia - SF/PF, re-evaluated in 2-3 weeks (Eye), 72 OVR (15th best player)  \nJa Morant - PG, fucked around and found out, 9 more games (Suspension), 92 OVR (best player)    \n\n\nThis gives us the 10 man rotation of:\n\nPG - Jacob Gilyard  \nSG - Desmond Bane   \nSF - Santi Aldama  \nPF - Jaren Jackson Jr  \nC - Bismack Biyombo  \nBench - Derrick Rose, Ziaire Williams, David Roddy, John Konchar, Kenny Lofton Jr.  \n\n \nTo further explain how these teams came to be, since there is some confusion, each team is starting at 100% health and losing the 1st, 4th-7th, 9th and 15th \"best\" players according to their 2k rating. The lineups aren't super thought out as I purely went down the list and got the highest overall that can play each position and the top 5 remaining went to the bench. \n\n\nNow, if we were to apply this logic/ranking removal to every other team in the league, who would be your winner for the inaugural injury cup? \n\n\n\n*Hawks*  \nPG - Dejounte Murray    \nSG - Patty Mills (TIL Patty is on the hawks)    \nSF - Wesley Matthews  \nPF - Sadiq Bey  \nC - Clint Capela   \nBench - Bruno Fernando, Kobe Bufkin, Garrison Matthews, Mouhmad Gueye, Seth Lundy\n\n\n\n*Celtics*  \nPG - Dalano Banton  \nSG - Jaylen Brown  \nSF - Lamar Stevens   \nPF - Sam Hauser   \nC - Kristaps Porzingis  \nBench - Luke Kornet, Oshae Brissett, Nathan Knight, Neemias Queta, JD Davison\n\n\n*Nets*  \nPG - Dennis Smith Jr  \nSG - Cam Thomas  \nSF - Dariq Whitehead  \nPF - Nic Claxton  \nC - Ben Simmons  \nBench - Trendon Watford, Day'Ron Sharpe, Noah Clowney, Harry Giles III, Armoni Brooks\n\n\n*Hornets*  \nPG - Ish Smith  \nSG - Terry Rozier III  \nSF - Gordan Hayward  \nPF - J.T.

Let me know thoughts. We are currently 3-12, tied for last in the Western conference. This season couldn't have started any worse.\n\nWe get Ja back in 10 games, on Dec 23rd at Atlanta Hawks. Meanwhile Luke Kennard will be reevaulated after first week of Dec, Tillman is 'week-to-week', and Smart is 2-4 weeks out as of today. Clarke is estimated to come back in March, and Adams is out for the season.\n \nThat means at worst, we will have these three guys back 4 weeks from now when Ja returns. **We have a 9 day break between Dec 2nd and 11th with no games** - did I miss something?\n\n Possible scenario:\n\nThe next 10 games:\n\n- vs Wolves\n- vs Jazz\n- @ Mavericks\n- @ Suns\n- vs Mavericks\n- @ Rockets\n- vs Rockets\n- @ Thunder - Kennard back\n- @ Pelicans\n- vs Pacers\n- @ Hawks - Ja Morant back, Smart back\n\nBeing realistic, we probably go at best 2-8 out of these ten games. I would guess we will end up **5-20** by the time Ja, Smart and Kennard are all back.\n\nIf we assume Tillman is back within 1-2 weeks from then, we would need to go **35-22** in the remaining games to finish with 40 wins, which might hopefully be enough to squeeze into the play-ins. \n\nDo you see this happening?

I could go into per 36 or whatever, but I just wanted to see how he compares to average center this year. Again, very basic. I also included the last 8 games since Booker returned which is statistically important. With just a glance, Nurk's actually been decent. The upper side of mid versus my expectation of just mid. The impact of Booker's return is quite clear with him getting far more comfortable in his role and looking a lot more spry than the first games.\n\n[This is for all centers, not just starting centers. Backups will bring the overall numbers down.](https://preview.redd.it/hjksivk80j3c1.png?width=687&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=358a69af1876e45d6a92b44fd9c1f8944fb7672e)\n\nAlso wanted to see his game to game trends for his most glaring statistical weakness, field goal %. The first 10 games were bad. 37% average, 34% if you remove game 1 outlier. But since the Booker return game 11, that trend has gone up quite a bit. Taking those last 8 games, he's just under league average at 52% and trending upwards. Take away the blowout Minnesota game 12 outlier and it comes to exactly league average for centers. Not that anyone should expect he will start to average 60+% FG% for the rest of the season, but it's encouraging to see for someone that came with a lot of reasonable concerns.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/434hm60w1j3c1.png?width=1532&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a62afc47006c1a1b214ae8bf7593a59681479c30", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.8088}, {"ranking": 0.8103448275862069, "comments": "Any OTA TV watchers not getting an HD transmission of channel 3?

This would be the most satisfying playoff series win (if we could pull it off) even more than the Nuggets IMO. \n\nHeat: I actually like Jimmy Butler for the most part, but I love beating his team in a head-to-head matchup. If not for Jimmy this rivalry wouldn\u2019t exist at all so I wish he\u2019d play us. Still, his interactions with Wolves fans are fun. \n\nThunder: Again, not a rivalry yet, but I love the matchups. We used to give them much more trouble but they\u2019re getting realll hot this season. \n\nAm I missing anything?

I have just now learned that The Wolves got eliminated from the in-season tournament on point differential by the Suns after both teams went 3-1 in their respective groups, despite the fact that neither team played each other nor did any team in each group play teams from the other group.\n\nMFer the reason that goal differential exists in soccer tournaments (which I'm sure is where the NBA got the concept from) is because in a full league schedule EVERY TEAM PLAYS EACH OTHER. And in particular goal differential for elimination tournaments like the EFL Cup or formerly the Champions League is used because it's the point differential BETWEEN TWO TEAMS THAT PLAYED EACH OTHER over two legs. You can't use point differential in unrelated groups, it's apples to oranges!\n\nThe Suns won their three games against the Jazz (12th in the West), the Blazers (13th) and the Grizzlies (14th). And the game they lost was against the Lakers who are only the 7th seed! They beat up on the 3/4 bottom teams in the Conference for three easy wins, and got further rewarded because it's easier to run up the score against bad teams.\n\nSince the tournament is double-dipping games from the regular season anyway, the obvious tiebreaker is just Conference standing. How tf did some NBA executive actually come up with point differential as a tiebreaker? It's not even some extreme corner case like how World Cup groups can rarely come down to yellow cards issued after like six other tiebreaks. In a 4 game set this will come up every single year, likely multiple times.

And some (all?) of these aren't realistic without sending out Kyle or Conley. If that's the price it's probably a pass for me on most if not all options.

I\u2019m less familiar with the specifics of his defensive reputation, but I don\u2019t get the sense that he\u2019s a turnstile. Scoring punch, shooting, effort and ball movement. Would be able to spell Conley without taking a large bite-bite out of his minutes. Likely not who you want as your PG of the future in the event we can\u2019t retain Conley moving forward. Would need an alternative plan for a mid-term starter*.\n\nTyus Jones ($14M/1 YEAR\u202611 PPG/3 RPG/5 APG\u202644%/36%/81%)\n\n*He\u2019s Tyus Jones. Thibs letting him leave was a top-5 egregious Thibs move on a list that\u2019s much longer than 5. Shooter, gamer, ball mover, floor raiser, solid culture guy. Would help with execution, organizing, temperament and turnover issues on this team. Could be re-signed to replace Conley without a precipitous dropoff in the event we can\u2019t retain him after this year. Likely very available given the state of professional basketball in Washington.*\n\nMonte Morris ($9.8M/1 YEAR\u202610 PPG/3 RPG/5 APG\u202648%/38%/83%)\n\n*Morris hasn\u2019t played this year with a quad issue, which the team recently announced will keep him out another 6-8 weeks.

Likely/rightly feels he\u2019s starting caliber and would take minutes from Conley (maybe this is a pro given Mike\u2019s age?). Toronto might not ever make him available at a value the Wolves can match.*\n\n**SHOOTER OR BENCH PLAYMAKER** (CURRENT CONTRACT...CURRENT AVGs...CAREER SHOOTING SPLITS)\n\nDoug McDermott ($13.75/1 YEAR...6.4 PPG/1RPG/1APG...47%/41%/81%)\n\n*You're telling me this Wolves team can't find a way to hide ol' Dougy McBuckets on defense? A definite firesale candidate as an expiring Spurs contract. We asked for shooting, the Dougster gets you that (albeit at a relatively unsavory price point this year).* \n\nCollin Sexton ($17.3M/3 YEARS\u202612 PPG/3 RPG/3 APG\u202646%/38%/83%)\n\n*With the Jazz pivoting to K. George as a starting PG, it\u2019s likely Sexton is about as on-the-block as it gets. Can he defend? Is this the best place to put $17 mil per year with the way our cap sheet looks? Maybe not.

You do not transform from being a losing team into a winning team overnight. Here are a bunch of reasons that trying to win is absolutely the best thing for this team, this franchise, and its players.\n\n\n\n**#1: It's what Ty wants to do**\n\nTyrese Haliburton *is* our franchise right now. He is the fire that our entire organization is huddling around and feeding, hoping it'll flame up into an inferno. If he wants to win, we have to show him that **this** is the place where he can do that. Look at other franchises who got a generational player and didn't try hard enough to win. Cleveland with Bron. New Orleans with AD. Us with PG. Portland with Dame. If you want a surefire recipe for your generational superstar to leave for a contender, not committing to winning is the single best way to do that.\n\n\n**#2: Winning builds chemistry and confidence**\n\nBasketball at the NBA level is a game about mentality. You need confidence to be a shooter, and if you lose that confidence you **will** lose your shot. If you ever wonder why Ty and Rick and the rest of the players show explicit trust in Buddy, *this is why.* Buddy is a shooter, and one of the best to ever at that skill. He needs to keep that confidence up in order to be successful at that skill. His team showing that trust is such a great sign of the bond these players have. Our chemistry is really damn good, and it's part of the reason that Ty makes the game look so easy.\n\n\n**#3: Winning helps players find their role**\n\n\nEvery team has stars, every team has role players. If your team keeps losing and losing and losing, it's much harder for role players to accept the role they're given, which hurts that team chemistry we rely on. We have a bevy of players who are committed to playing whatever role the team needs to in order to win. If we start dicking around, and play lower rotation guys over proven vets without caring about wins, it makes it much harder for the team to buy-in on the mission we have.\n\n\n**#4: Winning provides a blueprint for developing players**\n\n\nUnlike 2K, \"development\" is not just a thing that happens at the end of a season based on minutes played. Development happens in practice, it happens during off season training, it happens *under the eyes of coaches and trainers.* When a player comes back from an off season with a bunch of new skills, the development of those skills happened with a trainer and with a coach, not just because they got more minutes. The people who know best about who is good on the floor vs who is bad on the floor are inside that gym and inside that locker room.\n\nYou cannot just give minutes to rookies and expect some \"progress bar\" to fill up. When they're ready, they'll be ready. If you have a winning team, players on the end of the bench can clearly see what is working for the team. They can know which skills they need to be better than the guy above them at if they want to see the floor.\n\n\n\n**#5: Winning brings the fans**\n\n\nIf we were a tanking team, we would be struggling to fill the Fieldhouse on a good night. By committing to losing, you essentially tell your fans that they might as well not show up, and as a team with some of the lowest attendance in the League, we cannot afford that. If you want people to take us seriously, we need to try and win basketball games. If we want free agents, if we want to keep our players, the fans need to be in the fucking building.\n\n\n\n**#6: Winning raises the value of our players**\n\n\nThis is a bit more of a pragmatic point, but if we want to trade people like Buddy or Bruce, or Aaron, or even Myles, we need to raise their stock. We need to show that Buddy Hield is the guy you want to trade for. Honestly, right now we have a very deep team who scores a ton of points off of guys with incredibly cheap deals. We are, right now, being looked at very hungrily by every contender in the League. Our gaudy offensive numbers will help inflate the price for a lot of our guys, and nothing inflates the price more than a player demonstrating a significant impact on winning.\n\n\n(Unrelated, but I think we trade Buddy and Bruce and picks for Siakam after the Dec 14th deadline)\n\n\nTanking and intentionally losing will not save us. We are buried in young talent, we do not need more to develop. We are in the buying phase of contention, where we pick a few promising youngsters to develop and then trade for established stars. We should not be looking at the draft for a way forward, we should be seriously looking at ways we can get and keep the star players every team that contends eventaully needs.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9969}, {"ranking": 0.2413793103448276, "comments": "OG Anunoby and Tyrese Haliburton Are they the perfect fit?

As I am getting really burnt out on certain posts and comments, regarding, repetitive topics and these game-to-game overreactions. &gt;This team is in year 2 of a rebuild. Our star is 23. People tend to forget that because Tyrese is so much better than we expected at this point.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Rick's rotations don't matter, getting buy in from the team does. He's demanding effort and if you can't give it, you're going to sit and watch TJM dribble for 18 seconds and probably get 0 points.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Don't like it? Try harder on defense next time or Ben Sheppard is going to come in and take your spot while you think about what you've done.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I love it. These are adults and professionals. Rick isn't hitting them or otherwise assaulting them, he's challenging them. If they respond, the team will be better for it.\n\n\\- [u/MySabonerRunsOladipo](https://www.reddit.com/u/MySabonerRunsOladipo/)\n\nYou don't go from one of the worst teams in the NBA to one of the best teams in the NBA in a single season, but you can go from one of the worst to a pretty damn good team. In my opinion, we are a pretty damn (although inconsistent) good team. BE HAPPY. If you can't handle the bumpy back roads of young player and system development, well then stop complaining, and come back to the sub in 2/3 years when it's over and we are cruising more smoothly on the highway.\n\nThis is not rocket science and our head coach is going down as an all-time great. He's done nothing, but win - both as a player and a coach. He coaches hard and believes in young guys earning their keep. He isn't picking on him or taking anything out anybody, he's doing exactly what Mathurin asked. Rick is 75% of the final say in every draft pick. He drafted Mathurin and Walker because he saw something in them and now it's his job to pull it out of them over the next 3-4 years. Key words \"3-4 years\".\n\n**Mathurin wants to be coached hard**. **He literally asked to be coached hard and this has been documented and reiterated over and over again in publicly released interviews (I'm so tired of posting or commenting them as apparently they don't get read).**\n\nStop complaining because a guy that has played only 94 games isn't an All-Star, yet. He was incredible as a rookie last year offensively, but if the Pacers are going to win a title we need a \"complete player\" in him. The shift has focused on playmaking, passing, rebounding, and defense. If you can't see improvements in all those areas (let alone, factoring in he's playing with the 1st unit) then you need to learn how to watch basketball.\n\n**His offensive didn't magically disappear.** The kid was averaging nearly 20 points a game on like 24 minutes the majority of last season and then there was a slow decline as we started tanking harder after Haliburton was gone. He started his first 3 games of the season averaging 24 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, and 1.5 steals. He sat in the ranks of Michael Jordan (25 points per game) and 2 other players to score over 70 points in the first 3 games of their rookie season and Mathurin did it without playing 38 minutes a game like MJ and Lebron (51 points in his first 3 games). Yes, he was coming off the bench, but that further proves my point - add 14 more minutes per game like the others and Mathurin's averaging 30+ points per game.\n\n**Again, 94 games, Bennedict Mathurin has played.**\n\nKobe, Jimmy Butler, Jaylen Brown, shit even Bradley Beal (if you really factor in how high his minutes were from the jump and how much they inflated things) **and 100's of other guys didn't fully click until year 3 or 4 and would go on to become multi-year or perennial All-Stars.**\n\n**Look at Jimmy Butler's 3rd year** \\- and that was him averaging 39 minutes a game. **13.1/4.9/2.6.** If it wasn't for his great defense that man never would've seen the light of day. Mathurin is trying to do what he did, but in reverse - which is a lot easier and more likely to happen than having to develop your entire offensive game like Butler had to.\n\nMathurin's not had an easy life, I'm pretty sure he can handle Rick yelling and pulling him when he's fucking up on defensive - especially when he asked the man too. This isn't his rookie year anymore. Rick has always developed his players this way and if you look at his track record, in doing so - it's pretty fucking incredible.\n\n**He's not found his groove yet this year...** in this new, even higher paced system, now in the 1st unit (against better defense) **and he's still averaging 13/3.7/2 in only 24 minutes - as if that's god awful (when it's completely on pace with 100's of other future All-Stars at that period of timeb** He's also cut down his TO's like crazy and is showing flashes of excellent playmaking, decision making, rebounding, passing, and defense that weren't there last year. **AKA he's developing a lot all at once.**\n\nIf it's over halfway through year 3 year and Mathurin looks like shit and the exact same, yeah, maybe it's time to have the conversation. But guess what, that's 1.5 seasons away and he doesn't look like shit at all \"now\" - he just doesn't look like an All-Star.\n\n**Please people for the love of God or Buddha or Tom Cruise or an infinite nothingness, fucking relax and understand that this is all completely normal and a part of the process. Then take that relaxation, quadruple the dose, add Jarace Walker's name to it, and inject it into your veins.** Jarace will fucking play when it's time for him to play. If he's not playing, I'm pretty sure a damn Hall of Fame coach, going down with at least 1 ring, and potentially top 5 in wins all time... has a reason.\n\nAgain, if you can't handle the bumpy ride of a rebuild (that we literally just started) and the player and system development that comes with it- then come back in 2/3 years when the seas have settled and the wind is more fully in our sails.\n\nBut enough with these game-to-game overreactions and panicky, doomsday posts. It's getting exhausting and is such buzzkill nonsense in the sub, when we are an incredible spot and have came a long way at a super accelerated pace. Ironically, I think this has created some highly unrealistic expectations. We just need time, there is no skipping the \"growing pains\", and when the organization thinks it's right, the big guns will be brought in. But I promise bringing them in during the early stages of a developmental time period is not in the best interest of a realistic, future championship window.\n\nThank you for letting me speak my peace - whether you agree or not.

We need to develop a consistent second scorer...\n\nMathurin's 15.2 PPG in the 9 wins is actually pretty good considering he is playing 5 minutes less per game than last year... so per 48... that would be higher than last year.\n\nPacers needed a PF not another diminutive guard which is why the Bruce Brown signing was a head scratcher...  same thing for trading for Nwora last year  while Duarte was still there... Nwora who is a good player and warming up the bench with McConnell who always brings it. With Mathurin, Hield, Brown, Nembhard., TJ.. their guards are just so small... in today's NBA where 3 and D long wings dominate the game. What are the Pacers doing exactly? How are they drafting, signing, trading for?\n\nConclusion : too many short guards, not enough playing time for Mathurin, clean up bench make a trade and get a solid strong PF to play the 4 in exchange, freeing the bench and time for Mathurin to develop as a clear 2nd option because Haliburton can't do it all...\n\nLet the kid play.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9904}, {"ranking": 0.2413793103448276, "comments": "How disappointed will you be?

Opposing teams have a 55.3% EFG (22nd) against us. Note these rankings in parenthesis here are where the Pacers rank on defense (i.e. 30th = worst). There are three teams in the NBA that average that FT% on a regular basis (OKC, Philly, Miami) and league average is roughly 78%. Toronto is bottom-3 averaging 73% from the charity this season and shot 83% from the line against us. \n\nOKC has had a ridiculous start shooting 40.5% as a team from three (Pacers are 4th with 38.6% from three as a team behind Phoenix, Brooklyn, and OKC). League average is closer to about 36%! Pacers opponents would rank 2nd overall on 3pt% \n\nThis is insane. especially for a team that is also bottom-5 in giving up attempts (as the highest paced team possibly ever in NBA history we are obviously giving up a lot of attempts). \n\n#Opponent 3PA and FTA per game\n\nHowever! Interestingly enough, we are NOT giving up the most attempts right now - we are bottom-5 but I thought for sure we\u2019d be dead last. In fact, we are ranked 1st in giving up 3 point attempts to opponents and only giving teams 25.3 3PA per game!!!! Detroit and Lakers are both tied for last at averaging 29.1 per game. \n\nOpponents are averaging the most FTA and FTM against us. We\u2019re giving up 27.8 FTA per game which ties Orlando average per game in second place (Philly in first with 28.4 FTA). Us and Detroit give opponents 2 more attempts per game than the other 28 teams. \n\nTeams are averaging a cool 23.5 points per game off free throws against the Pacers. League average is about 17.5. Only Philly averages more than that any given night with 24.2 FTM per game (Phoenix is second with 22.1).\n\n#Other Observations \n\nWe are bottom-10 in rebounding but surprisingly not last. \n\nWe are top-10 in preventing opponent assists at 24.7 opponent assists per game and we are 1st at opponent assist per FGM at 0.541 (Chicago is last at averaging 0.554 assist per FGM). This is a good indicator that we don\u2019t allow open looks. \n\nWe are dead last in points in the paint giving up 62.3 points per game in the paint. First place in the league is Charlotte averaging 58.1 points in the paint (Pacers are second averaging 58!) League average is around 51.\n\n# Some eye test opinions\n\nteams have been shooting lights out against us. and hitting tough shots. Maxey, Giannis, Trae, Grant, and more have particularly roasted us no matter what we threw at them. \n\nWe definitely run guys off the line as much as possible however whatever switching schemes we\u2019re running has resulted in far too many easy and open looks around the basket and second chance points off opponent offense rebounds. The iron curtain on the three point line has often resulted in the lone center protecting opposing bigs and driving guards with the ball with one of our guards being late to rotate or provide any help or rebound. \n\nWe\u2019re letting bigs get easy looks around the rim and hoping Myles handles it or not and trying to out shoot them on the other end however teams have rose to meet us with their shooting but this will regress to the mean\n\nEDIT WITH MORE INFO:\n\nWide Open: 12.5 attempts a game (1 fewest in the league), teams shoot 40.5% (6th highest in the league).\n\nOpen: 9.6 attempts a game (1, fewest in the league), teams shoot 41.8% (highest in the league).\n\nIf opponents shot league average on their open/wide open 3s and free throws, which defense almost certainly has little to no impact on, they would score 5 less points a game. ((Opponent%-League Average%)*attempts allowed). That alone would have us at 12-4.\n\n^ this was a comment from u/beetlebailey97 who got the info from nba.com\n\nso Pacers are giving opponents the fewest open looks from 3 in the league and they are hitting them at a ridiculous rate so far, well above averages!", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9933}, {"ranking": 0.2413793103448276, "comments": "Hmmm ", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.2413793103448276, "comments": "What\u2019s the next move?

But they aren\u2019t really going anywhere until they make some moves. One of the reasons is that Mikal Bridges has plateaued as a scorer. Bridges is still extremely good in his role, and remains an excellent defender. But after progressing into a player who can create his own shot, he hasn\u2019t yet become a player who can do it at an elite level.\n\n&gt; Bridges is shooting only 35.3 percent out of isolations this season, and with more on-ball reps it means he\u2019s getting fewer chances to do what he does best: cut to the rim, attack closeouts off the catch, and shoot spot-up 3s.\n\n&gt; Cam Thomas and Ben Simmons missing games has put too much on his plate, but their return\u2014and eventual roster-clarifying moves\u2014will hopefully lead to Bridges playing a role more suited for him, one that maximizes all of his impressive capabilities.\n\n&gt; [[link](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2023/11/27/23977800/nba-power-rankings-denver-nuggets-boston-celtics#:~:text=is%20worth%20optimizing.-,21.%20Brooklyn%20Nets,-8%2D8%20record)]\n\nI don't disagree with this analysis at all, but at the same time-- the need to 'make moves' also makes me ask \"for *WHAT*, exactly?\"\n\nIs the writer really suggesting that we're only a couple moves away from being a contender?  \n Becaase that feels a bit over-the-top to me.\n\nPersonally, I've really been enjoying this season so far, and AFAIK our main goal going in to the break is to see how this collection of players fits together for the long-term.

I'm a huge Nets fan and was really looking forward to this, but it seems like I won't be able to make it.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone here knows whether these Ticketmaster tickets can be transferred to someone else who can attend. Does anyone have experience with transferring tickets for such events, or know the policy of the Barclays Center in this regard?\n\nAny help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThanks in advance!", "date": "20231121", "sentiment": 0.9735}, {"ranking": 0.4482758620689655, "comments": "Dunk of the year?

Against Moses.\n\nMoses Moody, by the Warriors\u2019 own belief system, should\u2019ve closed that game against the Kings. He earned at least a few more minutes. Because in the Warriors\u2019 denomination, the hot hand gets fed and, especially with this year\u2019s depth, those playing the best stay on the court.\n\nThen, suddenly, he was on the bench. He\u2019d just hit his third straight 3-pointer when he was taken out for Andrew Wiggins. A casualty of loyalty.\n\nTheir core players, their champions, then proceeded to squander the victory in crunch time, swallowing a hard 124-123 loss from the hands of their NorCal rivals. The Warriors went with their best lineup, the one that was great last year, the same collection of players that was central to delivering a championship just 17 months ago. They chose resumes over results.\n\nIt cost them the game. The way they lost \u2014 a whistle that grew increasingly sensitive, some unconscionable turnovers and a suddenly frigid offense \u2014 felt like a rebuke from the basketball gods. It was a meltdown of epic proportions, as epic as can be this early in the season, costing them a shot at the NBA Cup and eventually the game.\n\nBut if you believe in the Warriors\u2019 ideology about basketball, it was clear that spiritual violation was at the center of this latest collapse. Perhaps it\u2019s the basketball gods prodding them to do some soul-searching.\n\nBecause, once again, they\u2019ve got a youngster pushing the incumbents. Actually, they might have a couple of them currently in Moody and Brandin Podziemski. They\u2019d love a third, Jonathan Kuminga, to put them in this kind of betwixt. For the first time in this era, it\u2019s clear their best players aren\u2019t nearly as automatic as they used to be. They don\u2019t seem dominant enough anymore, their roster isn\u2019t constructed aptly enough to summarily dismiss youthfulness on principle.\n\nThe pressure is on them to perform or be fine with the nights the youngsters earn those minutes. The pressure is on Kerr to give the youngsters the rope they deserve, especially knowing that over the last couple of years, the superstars are as likely to blow a game as they are to take it over.\n\nThe Warriors lost this game because of their desperation to get their best players going as a unit. A fair and reasonable plan until Moody presented them with a reason to change it. This was a tangible instance of their dedication to their past champions costing them in the present.\n\nThe truth, though, is their chances at another championship must include the youngsters. And, fundamentally, must include a willingness to go in the direction necessary to win. Their legends can\u2019t just will themselves to victory like they once did. Sure, at times, they can be brilliant. It just doesn\u2019t come on cue, as they still seem to think. They are older. The league is better. The horizon line is visible.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the last time Kerr is faced with this tough decision. Because everything about Moody\u2019s play this year screams \u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d The same feels true for Podziemski. Though Kuminga hasn\u2019t maximized his opportunities, it still feels possible for him to force his way in.\n\nMoody\u2019s rise feels especially imminent because he\u2019s paid his dues. He abides by the Warriors\u2019 prescribed tenants. He handles the uncertainty of his career with the kind of class they rave about. It was just last April when Curry had to give a speech about buying in. He wasn\u2019t talking to Moody. They laud Little Rock\u2019s finest for his professionalism and unselfishness.\n\nThe other thing about Moody and Podziemski is they fill glaring holes in the roster. The Warriors do not have a second player who can just go create offense, go get a bucket or set someone else up for one. They have shotmakers. But they don\u2019t have creators. They don\u2019t have anyone who puts pressure on the rim consistently outside of Curry. When the Warriors double-teamed Fox on Tuesday, Kings guard Malik Monk went to work attacking off the dribble.\n\nGolden State leans heavily on the system to create offense. Wiggins at his best can go get a bucket, but ideally against proper matchups, and they\u2019re usually just for him. Paul\u2019s ability to get to his midrange jumper figured to be a huge value add, but he hasn\u2019t pulled it out as much.\n\nThe issue with that reality for the Warriors is they\u2019re prone to go cold. After making 12 of 25 from 3 in the first half, they probably should\u2019ve expected a shooting slump in the second half (5 of 16). When the opposing defense ratchets up and the legs get heavy at the end of games, the probability of their shots dips. That\u2019s why Moody should be playing. He\u2019s shooting 38 percent from 3 this year, 49.5 percent from the field. Like the other scorers, he doesn\u2019t create much offense. But he gives them another guy who can make good offense pay off.\n\nThey needed it badly Tuesday against the Kings. Sacramento was rallying, going from getting run out of the gym to surging towards the NBA Cup. And on his first touch of the fourth quarter, Moody blew past Monk on a baseline drive, dunking with two hands for his first points of the game. The next time down, he rattled home a wide-open 3 from the left corner. It was wiped away by an off-the-ball foul.\n\nThat was the plan all along. Kerr told Moody he\u2019d be out of the rotation with the return of Draymond Green. But the injuries to Paul in the first quarter and to Payton in the third quarter opened a door for Moody to play.\n\nMr. Stay Ready came in, made an immediate impact, and was on a heater while the other Warriors had cooled off. He deserved a chance to see where this night was headed. The only thing that might\u2019ve been hurt if Moody stayed on the court was someone\u2019s pride. But the Warriors are always preaching sacrifice. Their essence is to not be held hostage by ego.\n\nBut the Warriors\u2019 title hopes definitely rest on their best players. The plan was clearly to get them going. They played exceedingly well in the first half. All that was left was for them to close the deal. So Kerr went to them for crunch time, violating their own code.\n\nThe basketball gods punished them with a meltdown they won\u2019t soon forget.

It is a long season, but if they want to win a championship, they need to start working together better to capitalize on the fear and panic the other creates in a defense.*\n\n*Link for video links showing two-man actions:* [*https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp/p/light-years-ahead?r=2wmouo&amp;utm\\_campaign=post&amp;utm\\_medium=web*](https://open.substack.com/pub/lowmanhelp/p/light-years-ahead?r=2wmouo&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe difference between the NBA\u2019s reigning most potent two-man game of Steph Curry and Draymond Green (CG) and their up-and-coming counterparts Damian Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo (LA). It\u2019s simply a matter of Collective Thinking Power, and the CG combo has that in spades. They have played an astounding 40,588 Regular Season and Playoff possessions together and produced four championships. Compare that to LA\u2019s anemic 788 Regular Season possessions and *zero* Playoff possessions. There is nothing like an extra *forty thousand* possessions to enhance the Collective Thinking Power of two of the world\u2019s most creative, intelligent, and talented players.\n\n**Panic Thinking &amp; Two-Man Game Optionality - -**\n\nDuring a broadcast years ago, the legendary Coach Hubie Brown said, \u201cYou set screens to make defenders think. Great shooters make defenders panic thinkers, and when you panic, you make mistakes.\u201d Creating one moment of Panic Thinking (PT) for defenders every possession will lead to great offense.\n\nPT moments happen in two-man games when defenders are forced via screen or cut to make a quick decision to help, not help, or switch.\n\nThe more optionality the action creates, the more opportunities defenders have to produce a PT moment. Once a PT moment happens, it becomes an exercise of making simple reads for the offense: shoot or pass.\n\nCurry and Green do a masterful job of synthesizing their Collective Thinking Power into moments of pure panic for defenders.\n\n**Twelve Notes Then The Octave Repeats - -**\n\nThe three most common on-ball two-man games run in basketball are the pick-and-roll (PnR), dribble handoff (DHO), and Get action. If you have never heard of a Get action, it\u2019s pretty simple: you throw the ball to a teammate and then immediately follow it. The first layer of possible options players can produce in these actions are strikingly similar.\n\n*(List represents base options based on coverages: Switch, Touch-&gt; Drop, or Deep Drop)*\n\n1. The non-screening player uses the screen.\n\n\\*Options - Shoot, Drive, or Pass to the screener (roll or pop).\n\n2. The non-screening player goes away from the screen, a.k .a. refusal.\n\n\\*Options - Shoot, Drive, or Pass to the screener (roll or pop).\n\n3. The screening player keeps the ball in DHO or Get.\n\n\\*Options - Shoot, Drive or Pass\n\nWash, rinse, and repeat. All three actions have essentially the same basic options. These two-man games are the basketball equivalent of how Jackson Maine saw music. Twelve notes, and then the octave repeats; it\u2019s the same story told over and over. The general structure and options are always the same, but what makes a combination unique is how the players see those twelve notes.\n\nOf all the two-man games, the PnR has the most simple communication for defenders because it moves the slowest. It also has the lowest turnover risk because only the most skilled ball-hander of the two dribbles the ball. All five defenders have the opportunity to see the ball and man clearly.\n\nThe DHO creates more complications for defenders and can move much quicker than the PnR. Because the screener has the ball, the offensive player using the screen can move at a much higher rate of speed and ferocity to set up their attack angle into the screen. The inversion of the ball handler also takes away the opportunity for all five defenders to see the ball and man clearly. Finally, the DHO offers a golden opportunity the PnR does not: A catch-and-shoot three-point shot during the initial screening action. Catch-and-shoot threes are the holy grail for an NBA offense.\n\nBut by far, the most complicated action for defenders to navigate is the Get action. It supercharges all the speed, ferocity, and optionality of the DHO. Every possible option in the previous actions is available here, but with one massive difference: the screener has *not* used a *live* dribble. Any sniff of early help from the screener\u2019s man can be punished with an immediate dribble drive into a 4v3 attack. This extra layer of optionality of the Get action makes it the ultimate two-man game.\n\nEvery player must operate within these twelve notes. The great ones can see the space as a blank canvas of endless opportunities to create magic within.\n\n**Curry &amp; Green vs.** **Lillard &amp; Antetokounmpo - -**\n\nOver the years, the Varsity squad has figured out one crucial piece to the puzzle that still alludes their JV counterparts. This critical detail has become the lynchpin of their two-man game's creativity and success. Handoff opportunities at the point of inflection, like the ones in DHO and Get actions, are significantly greater than their live-dribble counterparts in the PnR.\n\nAccording to Second Spectrum, Lillard has run 10.4 PnRs per game and only 1.6 handoffs. Curry has run 8.0 PnRs per game and 2.5 handoffs. Curry also obliterates opposing defenders in these actions, scoring at an astounding 1.74 Points Per Possession (PPP) compared to 0.76 PPP in PnR actions. Meanwhile, Lillard sits at a respectable 1.25 PPP in handoffs and 1.00 PPP in PnR actions. Throughout an 82-game season, Curry is on track to score two hundred and twenty-two more points from handoffs than Lillard. Factor in all the buckets teammates score from the PT moments Curry creates in these handoffs, and you are talking about thousands more points per season.\n\nThe most significant *fear* factor the DHO and Get Action have over the PnR is its option for a C&amp;S or one-dribble three-point shot opportunity. These shots are the creme de la creme opportunities for elite shooters like Steph Curry and Damian Lillard, and the fear of giving up one of these opportunities sends defenders panic thinking into overdrive!\n\nCurry is taking 6.1 zero dribble threes a game and shooting a blistering 54.1% on those shots. He\u2019s also getting up 1.1 one-dribble threes a game and shooting a casual 60.0% on those attempts. That\u2019s a ridiculous 1.625 PPP. If that doesn\u2019t make you panic as a defense about giving him one of those shots, then someone needs to check your pulse.\n\nThe CG two-man game consistently keeps defenders off balance by creating these catch-and-shoot moments. They are challenging shots to get, especially when you are the best shooter on the planet. They are only possible because of the selflessness of both players operating within their two-man games. They work hard to set up intelligent cuts that enhance the other's skill set, creating endless optionality and moments of panic thinking for defenders.\n\nMy college coach, Roy Williams, used to have a \u201cthought of the day\u201d before every practice. On the first practice of every year, it was always the same: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what can be accomplished when no one cares who gets the credit.\u201d This quote perfectly embodies the CG two-man game.\n\nThe good news is that Lillard and Antetokounmpo have opportunities to shift their diet from less efficient play types like ISO\u2019s to more efficient ones like handoffs. Should they be turning more PnRs into Handoffs? Yes. But there is even lower-hanging fruit they can get to first.\n\nThe Varsity squad would *never* pass up on opportunities like the ones above to run a two-man action. They know that together, they create significantly more panic than alone.\n\nBut there might be hope for the JV. Recently, they have put handoff actions on tape that feature hints of creativity and optionality. Making you wonder if they are starting to understand they can play the twelve notes together and not just as the solo artists they have been all their careers. Or was it just a mirage born out of necessity? And not genuine cohesive creativity like the Varsity squad displays so often with the effortless ease of a Slash guitar solo.\n\nCG\u2019s two-man game has 40,558 possessions of Collective Thinking Power, a number that dwarfs any other current two-man game in the NBA, which they consistently use to create panic-thinking moments. The duo are magnets to each other and lean on their experience in high-leverage moments when a game is on the line.\n\n**The Special Sauce - -**\n\nThe CG two-man game contains Steph Curry, and the LA one doesn\u2019t. It honestly might just be that simple.\n\nLillard is often referred to as the second-best shooter behind Curry, and he might be, but the gap is vast (link). Over his twelve seasons in the league, Lillard\u2019s season high for made threes is 275 in 2020/21, and he has shot over 40% from three-point range just once, hitting 270 threes at 40.1% in 2019/20.\n\nMeanwhile, the walking supernova known to the world as Steph Curry has topped the 275-made threes mark six times in his fifteen seasons. Maxing out at an NBA record 402 made threes in 2015/16. Somehow, more impressively, is the fact that he has only shot below 40% from three-point range ONCE in his fifteen-year career, on shooting volume unknown to any other human walking the planet!\n\nPut that level of shooting together with the 40,558 possessions of Collective Think Power, endless creativity, and both players\u2019 genuine lack of ego, and it\u2019s easy to see why the Curry and Green two-man game is still *light-years ahead.*", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.9992}, {"ranking": 0.5344827586206896, "comments": "11 points, 4-4 from the field all in the fourth quarter.

It's also interesting that it's a home against the Clippers who now have Westbrook, Harden and Kawhi, 3 old nemesises from past championship runs and misses, conquered foes and pains in the ass on the franchise that was our first big rival. Oh, and Chris Paul will be there, as a Warrior. This seems significant on some cosmic level and I think there is more to it than the numbers on the date and the opponent.\n\nIf anyone hasn't listened to the Bob Meyers interview with Kawakami, I recommend listening to it before this next game. Bob spends a large chunk of the pod reflecting. From Lacob coming in, to Steve coming in, the first chip, the fiinals game 7 loss at home leading to Durant, losing Durant, Wiggins, the recent  chip. Bob's telling of the story as a thing of the past, something that he has decided to move on from but is currently and forever connected to, reframed my perspective of this current team. Bob's perspective is allowing me to process that this might be the end of either the dynasty or the trio that is synonymous with it. \n\nOne of the more subtle details of his story, but the part that I find most relevant to this year's team is when Bob talks about Steph's role in personnel decisions. He specifically brings up talking to Steph about going for KD, he talks about how most decisions he would make are ran by Steph to get his feel or approval. That made one thing very clear to me about this season, Steph is going to decide how many pieces the front office has to operate with come trade deadline.\n\nI think we all know that if LeBron was in Steph's shoes Klay likely would have been traded some time ago, or maybe he would have looked for an opportunity to win elsewhere. Those are classic LeBron moves. I am sure Giannis signed off on swapping out Jrue for Dame. But Steph is loyal to the Dubs and the teammates that created the Dubs Dynasty him with him. So he hasn't left, he won't leave, and his dudes are still here. But could that change?\n\nThere has been a lot of talk about trades and Klay's performance, about Kerr and his stubborn loyalty to his guys. Slater mentioned on the Light Years Pod that he expects the Dubs to be extremely active at the deadline. But exactly how active they are will be determine by the Baby Faced GM. \n\nWhether Steph decides to go for a chip at all costs or decides that going for a chip with Klay and Dray is the only way to do it,, he has earned the right to determine how his Warriors legacy comes to an end. I for one will be watching every second of it that I can because Steph is the all time greatest player on my favorite team. He changed the image of the Dubs from a loveable loser to a hated super villain. He changed the narrative around shooting in the league. It's no longer just a way for softer players and aging vets to stay in the league, shooting is the most lethal tool of the deadliest assassins. Every team has to make 3's now, every player coming up has to shoot from outside, even if you are built like Jokic, Wemby, Chet or Ant, every superstar has to shoot the 3.  \n\nIf you look at the schedule, tomorrow may just appear to be another November mid week game against the Clippers. But then look at the Dubs record. Then look at the the Dubs record in the last 10 games. Then look at the standings. Then look again at the date, 11/30/23, its the only one for another 100 years. A date that deserves to be an important day for this franchise, and I don't know how much more significant a game in November could be. \n\nWarriors Basketball, It's a Great Time Out.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9911}, {"ranking": 0.5344827586206896, "comments": "I love Klay I respect Klay and his achievements with the team.

Some examples: \n\n2021/2022 - 4-4 start before finishing 49-33\n\n2019/2020 - 12-10 start before finishing 44-28\n\n2018/2019 - 9-12 start before finishing 50-32\n\n2017/2018 - 19-28 start before finishing 48-34\n\n\nI went over to r/jazz to dig up some old threads and see what Jazz fans thought about Quin.  I did this when we signed him as well but wanted to circle around now that we\u2019ve seen the Quin product on the court.  Here are some interesting quotes that I think can be applied to the current state of the Hawks - \n\n&gt; \u201cAmazing playbook, but it will take your team time to learn it and some guys may never. Players' coach, gets close with his stars and vets but always with an eye toward competing, so it's not in a way that makes others feel shunned. Short leash for young guys but if one shows signs of being a real star he won't miss it.  Brings a very good developmental staff alongside him, most notable for finding new talents in old veterans.\u201d \n\n&gt; \u201cTop tier coach. Will put in a system, and that system may take some adjusting to, but once it's installed it's fantastic.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cGood schemes and sets. Had the number 1 defense and offense here in different years. Seems to get guys to improve individually.\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cHe expects his young players to know his system perfectly before he'll give them playing time, so he's usually got a short leash on them until they do. It also seems like a fairly unique system, conley had a rough time adjusting to it, but when it's clicking it's awesome\u201d\n\n&gt; \u201cEvery time we picked up a new guy it would take a year for them to fully integrate into the offense because the playbook is so insanely complex.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd a couple of quotes that show that Quin is already coaching a little differently than in Utah - \n\n&gt; \u201cdon't expect him to use challenges\u201d \n\n&gt; \u201cHe doesn't tinker with rotations. His starters are his starters and that seems to never change.\u201d \n\n\nSo yeah basically the point that I\u2019m trying to convey is that sure, things don\u2019t look amazing right now.  We are seemingly starting the season the same way we have the last two years, with the same shitty defense and inability to put a win streak together and stay above .500\n\nBut we are also seeing similarities between this iteration of the Hawks and Quin teams that had a lot of success.

This is just something interesting I noticed and wanted to share.**\n\nDespite the agonizing start for Trae, the Hawks are much better both offensively AND defensively when Trae is on and DJM is off so far this year. The ORtg jumps 3 whole points and the DRtg jumps a whopping 4.5 points in those scenarios. This is a more extreme continuation of what we saw last year, where the Trae-only minutes were a positive NetRtg and the DJM-only/Both lineups were negative with roughly equal DRtg and a big disparity in ORtg.\n\n**My takeaways:**\n\n* Dejounte Murray has great shooting splits this year, but he's not adding much more offensively compared to Bogi when playing within a SG role\n\n* Bogi is an incredible offensive SG to bring off the bench when healthy. We're lucky to have him.\n\n* As a PG, DJM is simply not on the same stratosphere as Trae in terms of being an offensive engine even though he has had more frequent efficient shooting nights so far this year.\n\n* Trae's defense (or the defense taking shape around him specifically) has improved significantly. DJM's has not. Bogi/Trae/DJM are all bad defenders, but so far the lineups featuring Trae indicate he's a better defensive ingredient or at least not the worst defensive piece of the three.\n\n**Reasons for optimism?**\n\n* Quin Snyder's offensive system is notoriously hard to master. It's understandable that Trae has adapted to it faster than DJM. That doesn't mean DJM won't figure it out as the season continues\n\n* Our NetRtg is already much better than our record implies despite implementing a new coach's system and Trae's putrid shooting in our first ~7 games. This team is capable of beating anyone on a good night.\n\nhttps://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612737&amp;Season=2023-24&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=1629027,1627749", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": 0.9587}, {"ranking": 0.46551724137931033, "comments": "We are done for You can\u2019t convince me this team is not cooked.

Bam - So far this season this is Bams team and will be until the playoffs where he'll take a slight step back to Jimmy\n2. Jimmy - The vocal leader of this team, does his thing but he needs to close better and not just chuck up shots because he thinks he's superman (he is but can't always think it will work)\n3. Herro - hoping he'll be here when he comes back, I would like him to incorporate his scoring to more team ball instead of iso and needing the ball in his hands. \n4. JJJ - His offense has been great and efficient, passes like a vet, but his defense is somehow even better than his offense. He might not be the flashiest player but he plays his role to a tee. Can't wait to see him improve even further. \n5. Duncan - Speaking of improvement....He's not just a shooter anymore, that's all that really needs to be said\n6. Lowry - Very underatedly leading our team in 3p%, shouldn't stop shooting. Defense is still good. \n7. Highsmith - Lockdown defender, 3+D = the greatest asset a role player can be in this league, still needs to work a bit on his offense though. \n8. Love - Still valuable, his 3p% isn't so great but I could swear I feel like 90% of his shots go in. High IQ on offense.\n9. Caleb - Good in spurts but I want playoff Caleb back. \n10. Jrich - I honestly don't see what others do with him, not a great shooter\n11. Dru Smith (pre-injury) - He was okay while healthy, everyone was a bit hard on him\n12. Thomas Bryant - Lost his spot in the rotation, still don't think he's horrible and we could use him against bigger teams. \n13. Jovic - Seems lost, Spo doesn't trust him, but I think he can fit other teams systems better. Maybe we should trade him at the deadline if Spo doesn't think he can improve his game to fit our system\n\nEdit: I was wrong about Jrich, after tonight he probably moves up 2-3 spots.

Sure, the Pacers have a great offense but the defensive effort was lackluster to say the least to start the game.\n\n I always talk about how little to no defense is played in today\u2019s NBA after the rule changes - but this was one of the more awful performances in a while for the Heat on that end.\n\nI still don\u2019t care for how much the Heat settle for 3s but at least they didn\u2019t do so as such an excessive rate like they often do - but thankfully they attacked the basket enough to get to the line a significant amount of times. I\u2019ll have to look but this feels like the most they\u2019ve gotten to the line all season. And one of the few times they had more FT attempts than 3 attempts.\n\nAnd - I know this will be unpopular but it was another (in my opinion) underwhelming game for Highsmith. Again, I appreciate and acknowledge the intangibles from him as much as anyone - but if you are going to start - especially after Bam went down - you need to do more one offense and with an inside game - not just jacking up perimeter shots.\n\nOrlando Robinson was underwhelming but that doesn\u2019t surprise me. Thomas Bryant was very active and should be getting more PT regardless of matchup.\n\nOverall, the bench was great.\n\nLet\u2019s see if the Heat can get another on Saturday without the frustrating start.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9819}, {"ranking": 0.7241379310344828, "comments": "[Game Thread] Indiana Pacers (9-7) @ Miami Heat (10-8) - 11/30 7:30 pm ET **[Indiana Pacers](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pacers) (9-7) @ [Miami Heat](http://www.reddit.com/r/heat) (10-8)**\n\n| Game Details |  |\n|--|--|\n| **Tip-Off Time** | 7:30 pm ET |\n| **TV Broadcasts** | BSSUN, NBA TV |\n| **Radio Broadcasts** | WQAM/WAQI, SiriusXM |\n| **Game Info &amp; Stats** | [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/game/IND-vs-MIA-0022300267/box-score#box-score) |", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7241379310344828, "comments": "Little brother activity ", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.7241379310344828, "comments": "Damn JJJ being a great guy outside of the game &amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8u8qjes86f3c1.png?width=1180&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9816c16e92c002a741a2888133e4b3b74443cbc1", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.34}, {"ranking": 0.7241379310344828, "comments": "[JJ Redick] \u201cJaime Jaquez Jr., outside of Chet Holmgren and Victor Wembanyama, has been the best rookie in the NBA this year...
