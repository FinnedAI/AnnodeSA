It seems like Evero has some of the same vibe as Tomlin did after his stint as MIN DC\n* Of the current or former college HCs, Campbell seems like the strongest candidate\n\nMy 2 cents:\n\n* If Pierce can coach to a .500 or better for his games as interim HC, the job is his. Inheriting a shitshow mid-season is a tough situation and the team has already been better\n* I doubt Gruden will drop his suit. I think Gruden is pissed and will not relent until Goodell is canned and the league is exposed for its hypocrisy. He's understandably out for blood\n* While it's been the trendy thing to get an offensive-minded coach, of all the NFL coordinators, I think Evero will be most successful as HC. DeMeco Ryans is a current example of a defensive-minded coach whose rookie season has been a huge success. It's about leadership. This is why Tomlin has been so successful\n* I've always thought the Niners were nuts for canning Harbaugh. I thought most of his bad rap was due to his conflict with Balke, but Hondo said Harbaugh would wear out his welcome eventually", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9647}, {"ranking": 0.4166666666666667, "comments": "Pac-12 championship At least we can end the Penix/Nix infatuation now, right?", "date": "20231202", "sentiment": 0.5423}, {"ranking": 0.4166666666666667, "comments": "How do you feel about Ameer Abdullah?

Now let me preface this by saying, I don't want any hostility towards anyone here. This is a genuine discussion I want with you all as this seems to be the big topic now entering the bye week.\n\nLooks like AOC won't be the guy (I feel this even with what I have to say), dude is just too immobile for todays NFL and just doesn't have the arm to be a true Raider QB. We NEED downfield accuracy, it's why I feel so many were able to put up with Carr for so long cause he could throw dime 60+ yards. Don't get me wrong, AOC is a solid player and I hope he can fix his woes, but that's up to him and his work ethic cause those issues are physical and mechanical. However, a lot of it has to do with habit and muscle memory which is a tough task to rewrite so it's not likely he succeeds here unless we hire some QB guru.\n\nWith all that being said, us as a collective of fans have now shifted our crosshairs toward the future and have begun discussions on which QB to take in the draft. Last year and into this year, people were clamoring about how this QB class was a great one and had some depth to it unlike last year. Unfortunately, each game I see or hear about just gives me less and less confidence in it. Quarterbacks entering the NFL are such a crapshoot and I'd really hate to waste resources and the time our stars have here trying to get some poor kid to quickly acclimate to everything the job of an NFL QB comes with.\n\nLet's look to Andy Reid and the Queefs, they picked up Alex Smith and he did what was asked of him while the FO built a team around him that could keep the team at a playoff level as long as the signal caller was anyone who could play at an above average level. This is a strategy Raider Nation MUST employ.\n\nAs of now, our biggest areas of need outside the QB position are (in no particular order): Offensive Line, interior D-Line, CB1 &amp; both Safety positions. We need an immediate impact player at one of these positions in the upcoming draft or it's just gonna be more of what we're seeing now, next year. Simple focusing on our needs in the trenches alone would pretty much give this team the juice it needs to be a playoff contender.\n\nGiven some of the names at QB going into FA (Cousins, Tannehil, Mayfield), I just dont see why it would be a big deal to get one of these guys while we build up this team and get them to a competitive, playoff level of football so that way the QB won't have to be asked to do much. Tell em to do their best Trent Dilfer and trust the team and system around him to do most of the work. That way we don't have to try so hard to \"pick the right guy\" and instead let the right find come to us like Mahomes did with the Chiefs. I think a lot can be said when a team is more relaxed at picking their future because they e got everything else secured. Most teams in huge distress and dysfunction tend to make sloppy decisions because they need to act now. We can avoid this if we just get this team to be complete with a game manager.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9001}, {"ranking": 0.4166666666666667, "comments": "Too bad it wasn't to the face.

Unfortunately, these moves have not panned out for them. They are currently 4-8 and the season seems to be over for the Giants, it\u2019s time to see their midseason needs. \n\nOffense\n\nQB: 10/10 - Daniel Jones hurt his neck earlier this season and then tore his ACL so it\u2019s very unlikely he\u2019ll come back early this season and he hasn\u2019t been good at all this year. Tyrod Taylor and Tommy Devito are not the future of the organization. The Giants need to draft a QB early. \n\nRB: 7/10 - I have no clue why Saquon wanted to stay with the Giants but as of now, he\u2019s the Giants\u2019 starting running back. Although he\u2019s good, he\u2019s going to need help now that Matt Brieda is likely going to walk. \n\nWR: 8/10 - While Jalin Hyatt and Wan\u2019Dale Robinson are good receivers, the Giants need a true WR1 to complement them. Darius Slayton will be a free agent and even still, he\u2019s inconsistent. Definitely in need of upgrading. \n\nTE: 4/10 - Darren Waller has the potential to be a great tight end for the Giants if he can stay healthy and get the ball. Daniel Bellinger is a good TE2 and a good blocking tight end. Not a bad duo but could potentially look a TE3 in Day 3. \n\nOL: 9/10 - I was going to break this up between tackles and interior but this unit is so bad that I put them together. The only reason this isn\u2019t a 10 is because of Andrew Thomas. Though John Michael Schmitz has potential, Evan Neal looks like a bust and Justin Pugh and Mark Glowinski are hitting free agency. The o-line needs major help especially the interior. \n\nDefense\n\nIDL: 8/10 - The Giants did good by trading Leonard Williams for a second round pick but him leaving leaves a hole at DT for the Giants. Dexter Lawrence is a stud and a building piece for the Giants\u2019 defensive line but after him is a pretty lackluster group. Furthermore, A\u2019Shawn Robinson and Nachos are going to be free agents. \n\nEDGE: 8/10 - Kayvon Thibodeaux is looking to be the pass rusher of the future for the Giants but he needs help. Azeez Ojulari is always injured and never dependable and there\u2019s very little depth outside of him. While it shouldn\u2019t be a first day need for the Giants, they need to consider giving Thibodeaux a guy opposite of him. \n\nLB: 3/10 - It feels like the first time in forever that the Giants don\u2019t need a linebacker. Micah McFadden and Bobby Okereke look a great linebacker duo. There is no definite answer that the Giants will bring Isaiah Simmons after this season so they can draft and add pieces for depth behind them. \n\nCB: 6/10 - Deonte Banks is looking like a stud for the Giants and Cor\u2019dale Flott looks like a good nickle but after them is a lackluster group. Adoree Jackson will be a free agent and Tre Hawkins is constantly picked on when he\u2019s on the field. The Giants have to address CB2. \n\nS: 5/10 - This can go up depending on if the Giants retain Xavier McKinney or not, he\u2019s played much better in the last few weeks and Jason Pinnock has played at a high level. They\u2019re a great tandem but they need depth. \n\nOverall, the Giants have work to do but their roster is at least salvageable with the young pieces they have.

I'm someone who for a while has wondered why do first time coaches always see success in year 1 (Judge went 6-10 in year 1 but people liked how the team played down the stretch) only for it to crash and burn in year two and for the fans to rightfully want the head coach fired which it happened. Daboll had a lot of success in year 1, won a playoff game but like coaches past, things fell apart in year 2. However I don't see much of the vitriol towards the team and the coach as in the past when the year 2 collapse happens. What do you think makes Daboll different than the other coaches that you feel comfortable giving him a longer leash to coach the team. Is it just a gut feeling or simply not wanting to fore another coach after two years?  Also where does 2023 rank compared to 2021 and 2017?

I see the argument on both sides and in the end it seems like it really comes down to the intangible stuff. My understanding is the following:\n\nPro-Tanking:\n \nGives a higher draft pick which results in a better prospect in the draft. No guarantee of any means of making the team better long term (teams miss on draft picks all the time), but theoretically gives the team a better chance in the future if a pick pans out. Essentially, more losses now for more wins later. People in this camp would rather have a dramatic move/sacrifice a season in order to shake things up and get out of the cycle of mediocrity.\n\nAnti-Tanking:\n\nTanking kills team morale and a top pick does not automatically mean future success (again teams miss on picks constantly). The goal here would be to have more faith in our guys and develop them by building a winning culture with what we have. People on this side want to take the slower approach and build something even if it means staying middle of the pack for a long time.\n\n\nI think people need to look more at past examples of top picks changing teams versus homegrown developed teams and their success rates rather than throwing out random draft pick success and bust stories (because there are a ton either way).

We're currently sitting at 4-7 with a sub 1% chance at the postseason. With all that in mind, a lot of fans are counting the dollars we have in cap space, the most of any team this offseason and looking for the best draft picks that they can find. If you want to win some games, you can scroll past this post; it's not really for you except the last paragraph. With all that in mind, here is who such fans will be rooting for.\n\nTeams on Bye: Ravens, Bills, Bears, Raiders, Vikings, Giants\n\n**Keep Pace Regardless of Outcome**\n\nThese are the games that if we happen to win this weekend, an outcome that hardly anyone in the fandom would cry over given the opponent, we can still maintain our spot in the draft order if the emboldened teams do the same.\n\nLions @ **Saints**: Not impossible for New Orleans seeing how the Lions almost lost to Chicago, and it's in the Superdome. Weaker SOS for the Saints and them being a game ahead of us.\n\nBrowns @ **Rams**: Weakens our SOS and helps lower the draft stock of a team that just might pass us if we get hot towards the season's end.\n\nChiefs @ **Packers:** Green Bay has one more win than us with a weaker SOS with six of the nine teams in draft order being from the NFC.\n\n**Bengals** @ Jaguars: Cincinnati is in a position to end this season on a really sour note with Jake Browning as the starter, and they're one game ahead of us. Besides, the bragging rights for beating Burrow while the present regime in Jacksonville can't even beat Jake Browning will hit like crack.\n\n**Can Pass with a Loss**\n\nThese teams are those that we need to win if we want to actually gain ground in the draft order this week.\n\n**Chargers** @ Patriots: Yes, New England has a stronger schedule than us. Yes, San Diego is a common opponent that affects our SOS. No, that does not mean that a Chargers loss would be necessarily beneficial to us. They could be cutting old wideouts or defenders, so they could interfere with our desired wideout if Fashanu and Alt are off the board.\n\nFalcons @ **Jets**: The Jets are going to be just as if not more desperate for offensive line help than us with a weaker schedule to boot. Furthermore, a Falcons loss weakens our SOS. We should be hoping for a competitive NFC South race overall.\n\nDolphins @ **Commanders**: Sam Howell is the most sacked QB in the entire NFL, and the Fins are a common opponent. Enough said.\n\nPanthers @ **Bucs**:  If last week taught us anything, there's bad (us) and there's utterly hopeless (Carolina). With Mike Evans a pending free agent, let's not deal with another wideout competitor.\n\n**SOS Alone**\n\nThese games shouldn't be in your primary interest, but our SOS is really high, and we could use other teams having dealt with harder hands than us.\n\nSeahawks @ **Cowboys:** This is being written after the Dallas game, so we got what we wanted, a weakened SOS.\n\n**Cardinals** @ Steelers: Mike Tomlin's not going to finish with a losing record let alone threaten our draft position. Added bonus is Arizona inching away from MHJ.\n\nNiners @ **Eagles**: Philadelphia has two of the three AFC teams ahead of us on the docket.\n\n**Final Scenario**\n\nIf everything proceeds like so, we would have the 6th overall pick in the draft. Barring some unforseen developments, we can assume Williams, Maye and MHJ will hear their names called first. That leaves one of Alt, Fashanu, Nabers, or Bowers available for the taking.\n\nIn the other scenario, winning is its own reward, with locker room chemistry retained and free agents wanting less to come play here. Regardless of what happens: **we have our quarterback for 2024 if not much longer.** There's no crunch into needing to find Tannehill's successor like there would've been without Levis in the fold. Furthermore, one of the main forces behind our dire straits has been the offensive line and the left tackle spot in particular. If Jaelyn Duncan can continue to develop into a franchise blindside down the stretch, that's another major need we can probably cross off our list, giving Ran Carthon one fewer distraction from his effective BPA drafting style. All in all, this is just an exercise to see how much ammunition we could give Carthon in late April. He has earned my full trust in guiding us back to relevance with a Lombardi down Broadway in the very near future.

For this week, we will be donating to the Elephant Sanctuary located in Hohenwald, about an hour and a half outside of Nashville. Their mission is to  provide captive retired elephants from circuses and zoos with care, companionship, and sanctuary as well as educate the public of the complex needs of elephants in captivity and the crisis facing elephants in the wild. Elephants are extraordinarily intelligent creatures, capable of distinguishing between human languages, using tools and even mourning their dead in addition to their renowned strong memories. Unfortunately, there are only \\~40,000-50,000 elephants worldwide left around the world with some species even being marked as critically endangered with their main threat being poachers that harvest their tusks as well as habitat loss. Elephants make up not only a keystone species for their ecosystems in Africa and Asia, they also provide value to local communities through tourism and other sources of income. \n\nThe link to donate is below.

They also had an NFL defensive rookie and offensive rookie of the year during that time. \n\nThe drafting was top notch when Floyd Reese was GM and the team drafted Jevon Kearse,Keith Bulluck and Albert Haynesworth those first years in Nashville. Letting WR Derrick Mason go was a big mistake but they were in salary cap hell at the time. \n\nChris Johnson was a really good pick by new GM Mike Reinfeldt in his second draft in 2008 and the next year CJ ran for 2,000 yards and set the NFL record for most yards from scrimmage with 2,509 yards a record that still stands as CJ is the only NFL player to ever gain over 2,500 yards in a season.\n\nIn 2011 they brought in Matt Hasselbeck and at the time i wish they would've waited on drafting a QB as Jake Locker had accuracy as well as injury issues. Hass led the Titans to a winning record that year and of course the next few years there would be a rough period before things got on the right path again.\n\n2013 one of the few things GM Webster did right during his tenure was signing Delanie Walker one of the best TEs the team has had.\n\nIn 2016 JRob took over as GM and did well starting out getting the team back winning again bringing in RB Demarco Murray and drafting Derrick Henry along with safety Kevin Byard.\n\nIn 2018 Mike Vrabel took over as head coach and his first four years he had winning seasons winning a couple division titles and appearing in an AFC title game.\n\nIn 2020 Derrick Henry had a 2,000 yard season rushing and Titans are the only NFL team with two seperate 2,000 yard rushers.\n\nLast season and this one the team is dealing with the fallout from JRob and his bad decisions in drafting as well as trading AJ Brown.\n\nHoping our new GM Ran Carthon can right the ship.\n\nI also hope Levis development goes well due to the O line issues at the moment.\n\nLooking back over the teams first 25 years we had an entertaining team that had some really good players at times and came close several times in the postseason. No other team in the league had better RBs as Eddie George,Chris Johnson and Derrick Henry were all excellent and CJ as well as Henry has shattered records with so many long TD runs including Henry's 99 yard run which in 2018 was the longest in NFL history along with Tony Dorsett's 1983 run.\n\nI've been a Titans fan since day one in 1999 and the only really tough stretch was 2012 through 2015 four straight losing seasons and thats the longest stretch they had without a winning season. \n\nI couldn't imagine being a fan of a team like Jacksonville where they have had just 4 playoff berths since 2000 and have had 14 seasons with 10 or more losses.\n\nWe are knocked at times for not winning a title but i think the Titans will get titles in the future and our time will come.\n\nThere have been several times the Titans have had chances to win a title but fell short and the latest one was 2021 against Cincy turnovers doomed us just like in 2008 and 2000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm hoping lord willing to be here for the next 25 years and during this stretch we will definitely hoist a couple Lombardi's......\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231124", "sentiment": 0.9984}, {"ranking": 0.42424242424242425, "comments": "[TD] Vrabel says Kearis Jackson is still a little way to being back on the field.

If they beat the Panthers and then beat us next week, they remain very much alive in the playoff race. If, however, they lose, and then lose again the week after to us (and if we beat the jets too) this virtually knocks them out of the playoff race. It's not mathematical elimination, but they have to start winning the rest of their games and hope that us and the Aints collapse. \n\n\n\nSaints: next week (lions) is likely their biggest remaining challenge of the season. If they can win they will keep pace with us in the race (or overtake us, if we lose to the jets) after that they have two likely easy wins against the panthers and giants, then the rams (potential wild card slot) and bucs (potentially eliminated after that week) before finishing with a home game vs the falcons.

After that is Panthers, colts, and bears. Like the saints, we could catch fire down this stretch as well, and like the saints, Arthur smith could shoot himself in the foot twelve times.

With how Desmond Ridder has been preforming I think Matt Ryan would be a far better QB. Taylor Heinicke has preformed alright in the 3 games he has played but we have yet to see Logan Woodside play on the field. Although having a bit of a history of messing up here and there with things such as fumbles, I personally think that Matt Ryan would most likely throw less interceptions than Ridder, and most likely get more touchdowns and passing yards. His veteran experience and overall knowledge of the game makes me think that with the current stats of Ridder, it wouldn\u2019t exactly be a terrible idea to see how well Ryan can preform. \n\nThis was just a thought that I had. Have always been a big fan of Matt Ryan and the falcons as a whole, and only want to recommend things that I think could benefit the team in one way or another.

Granted, there were a few situations where we would've loved to see DTR check into a run early on, but that's a different conversation.

Randall Cobb motions in to crack Jaelan Phillips, and Breece Hall gets the toss to (ideally) get around the corner behind Nick Bawden. The motion is pretty slow, and not only does Phillips see it, but he bench presses Cobb so far sideways that he takes himself out of the play. Now while Cobb could probably bring a little more on the block, this is putting him in a position to fail. Allen Lazard has not been playing well, but one thing you know he's good for is run blocking. Having him inactive just to put Randall Cobb out here is just a confusing decision. Even without Lazard, why are we picking the 5'10, 190 pound receiver to make this block when we have no problem splitting CJ Uzomah out wide on pass plays? This could be any of our three tight ends and it would probably change nothing, as it's not like the Dolphins have extra DBs on the field. Again, the result of the play is fine, it's just that this is making things more difficult on both Randall Cobb individually as well as the offense as a whole.\n\n[3rd and 11 from the NYJ 36](https://streamable.com/doc4by)\n\nThe first head-in-hands call of the day comes early for Hackett. It's 3rd and 11, so we put our best receiver in the slot and have him run a 5 yard quick out into a cloud corner. There are a number of things wrong with this play. First of all, the concept is designed to pick up 5 yards. Second, the #1 receiver on that side is Dalvin Cook, who runs a go route so slow that Garrett Wilson is actually farther up the field after coming out of his break. Third, because that outside corner is never threatened, he sees the out coming from a mile away. No matter how much separation Garrett gets from that linebacker, he wouldn't have a chance to pick up a first down. On the backside Tyler Conklin is attempting to run a stick-nod on the other side, but that's never going to be there with the defender playing inside and on top of him since it's third and long. If you're dead set on having Garrett run a quick out, put someone with some speed on the outside and have them line up on the line of scrimmage. You can't high-low the corner when the high and the low are at the same yard line.\n\n[1st and 10 from the NYJ 5](https://streamable.com/ue8cep)\n\nAfter a great 4th down stop by the defense, the Jets are backed up near their own goal line. Nathaniel Hackett chooses this opportunity to pull out the play action pass. Not only is there nowhere for Boyle to throw the ball, since it's a three man route with Nick Bawden having to navigate traffic at the line before getting into his route, but Jeremy Ruckert is isolated on the backside trying to block a very good edge rusher in Jaelan Phillips. You'd like to see him hold up better in pass protection, but as an offensive coordinator, you're playing with fire expecting him to do that so close to the goal line. If anything, this is the time to call that stick concept to get some breathing room and set up a 2nd and manageable. Instead, we're lucky that Boyle manages to avoid the safety.\n\n[3rd and 10 from the NYJ 5](https://streamable.com/0afyoa)\n\nOn third and long (again) we run another \"run to the sticks and turn around\" concept against man coverage (again). This time, we actually give some help on Jaelan Phillips, and it results in Breece Hall effectively running a nothing route. Garrett Wilson is in press coverage and is never open. Tyler Conklin is also chipping and running a flat, which which makes it incredibly easy for the Dolphins to cover up our three best receivers/playmakers. The only true option for Boyle here is to throw the curl to Jason Brownlee at the top of the screen. I think that's actually a throw he should make, but that's also Jalen Ramsey in coverage, which is not a matchup you want to try often. Boyle checks it down to Conklin before Brownlee is anywhere near the top of his route, and the Dolphins predictably rally to make the tackle.\n\n[3rd and 3 from the NYJ 43](https://streamable.com/hckzuj)\n\nOn a short third down from near midfield, the Jets come out in a bunch formation with Garrett Wilson as the #3 receiver. Bunch formations can be really helpful in getting guys open because of how defenses play them. A lot of times, they'll have first-man-out or first-man-in rules instead of just man coverage across the board, so a good scheme can really take advantage of some of the matchups with switch releases and routes that work away from the leverage. The Jets, of course, do none of that. Jalen Ramsey has the first man out, which is Jason Brownlee on a speed out from the #1 in the bunch. The nickel and LB are banjo-ing the next two receivers, meaning that one of them plays inside the bunch and one outside, and they take whichever of the two breaks to their side. This is where a good route concept could have either Garrett Wilson or Xavier Gipson running an out-breaking route against a linebacker with inside leverage. Instead, Gipson runs a corner and gets covered by the nickel, while Garrett runs a sit over the ball in between two linebackers. Unrelated to the bland route concept, Tim Boyle displays some impressively poor pocket presence, and gets himself sacked instead of stepping to the right and hitting Garrett or Breece Hall for a first down.\n\n[3rd and 2 from the NYJ 30](https://streamable.com/jeynyt)\n\nAgain the Jets come out in a bunch on third and short, but this time they shift to a 2x2 formation. Nobody follows Garrett Wilson to the other side of the formation, indicating zone coverage, and the Dolphins end up bringing pressure. With four linemen and two linebackers potentially bringing pressure against a 5-man protection, the line slides to the left, leaving the right edge rusher as Boyle's responsibility. He plays it quickly and hits Breece Hall on the flat out of the backfield. The problem on this play is Xavier Gipson's route. He and Jason Brownlee are running a scissors concept, but Gipson almost looks like he's faking a stalk block before getting out. I don't know if it's designed like that, but because of how long it takes, the nickel is able to sit on top of the route and drive on Breece as soon as the ball is thrown, and he gets there before Breece can make a move. It's a bit of a case of the defense having a good call for the play we end up running, but the spacing is too tight for the flat to be a viable hot throw. A true swing would also not only help the spacing, but give Breece more room to catch the ball going forward and make a move instead of catching it with his back turned and getting tackled immediately.\n\n[2nd and 6 from the NYJ 31](https://streamable.com/q1qjkt)\n\nThis one has all kinds of bad going on. Naked keepers are becoming more and more prevalent in the NFL with the emphasis on playmaking QBs, but they come with some drawbacks. A lot of the time you're leaving an edge player unblocked, so in a worst case scenario, they don't fall for the run fake and are flying directly at the QB. The first mistake the Jets make, in my opinion, is that they leave the 4 technique over Max Mitchell unblocked. He jumps into the C gap and sees the play action coming from a mile away. Boyle also comes out too horizontal, which is problematic on nakeds because it effectively shortens the distance between a QB and the potential edge pressure and gives him less time to make a play. So by the time he turns his head, he has a defender 5 yards in front of him and there's no chance to continue rolling out. At this point, the only option is to throw it to the flat, and if that's covered, throw it in the dirt and come back for 3rd and 6 instead of 3rd and 10 or more. The only problem - there is nothing in the flat. Jeremy Ruckert is blocking the edge player and never releases on a route. Whether that's Ruckert's fault on a missed assignment or the play was designed that way, there are mistakes across the board and this play was doomed from the start.\n\n[3rd and 3 from the NYJ 45](https://streamable.com/9zwhin)\n\nThis one is a little bit of a nitpick, but I see it so often in our offense that I want to call it out. On third and short, we run a slant-flat concept with Tyler Conklin and Breece Hall. The flat is open, but Breece is once again tackled short of the sticks without a chance to make a move. A better ball and we might pick this up, but I don't like how often Breece is catching these passes with his back to the defense. There's about 8 yards of space between him and the defender when Boyle releases the ball, but by the time he catches it and turns his head, he's only a yard past the line of scrimmage and the defender is already in position to make the tackle. Breece is incredible in the open field and I like the idea of getting him the ball in space, but this is not that. Not only are we forcing him to spin all the way around to catch a pass, but he's not even past the line of scrimmage. If you want a true slant-flat concept, have him run it out of a wing position instead of the backfield and let him actually get somewhat down the field. Otherwise, if we want to get him the ball in space, give him a swing route where he can see the defense and catch it with some forward momentum. Again, it's a nitpicky criticism, and it's not like it can't work, as you'll see later. But this is the second time this game where this exact thing has happened on a third and short. \n\n[3rd and 4 from the MIA 19](https://streamable.com/z2epkv)\n\nAnother example of getting Breece Hall the ball in space in a sub-optimal way. The concept this time is good. We have a bunch to the top of the screen, and they're all running crossing routes while Breece comes from the backfield on the opposite side and runs a flat. The idea is that against man coverage, which the Dolphins are in, there will be a lot of traffic for whoever is covering Breece to navigate, and we can get him on the edge with a chance to turn it upfield. That's exactly what happens, but we miss a potential touchdown because it's not executed properly. Jason Brownlee, the #2 in the bunch, is running directly at the linebacker who's covering Breece, but he makes no effort to set a legal pick or even get in his way. Breece catches the ball and gets the first down purely because of his speed. If Brownlee or Randall Cobb can even just make #51 hesitate going through traffic, this play has a chance to score. I'm not necessarily putting this on Hackett, but it's another example of our playmakers not being put in the best position they can be put in.\n\n[2nd and 6 from the MIA 20](https://streamable.com/0wtdhz)\n\nThis one is on Tim Boyle. Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall are the two receivers on the right side, while Tyler Conklin and our undrafted rookies are on the left. The Dolphins are playing a soft Cover 4, and Breece is wide open on the spot route. It's hard to tell where Boyle is looking with the black helmets, but it seems like he's staring down the middle of the field. He comes over to the right side way too late and throws a back-foot throw that's tipped and picked off. I don't know why Boyle is looking to the middle of the field, but he plays this way too slowly. If you want to work the right side of the field, which I certainly would, seeing as your two best players are over there, you have to get your eyes there immediately. Instead of a catch-and-run opportunity for Breece, it's a turnover in the red zone.\n\n[1st and goal from the MIA 1](https://streamable.com/4r1sbu)\n\nFinally, a simple concept that makes life easier for Garrett Wilson. For context, most of the time he's has been the #1 receiver on the left side these last couple drives, the Dolphins have been putting Jalen Ramsey in man coverage against him. On this play, Garrett and Xavier Gipson are lined up tight to the line, and the Dolphins have two corners overtop of them. On the snap, they run a switch release, with Garrett running a crosser and Gipson running an outside route that turns into a two-arms-up backpedal because NOBODY covers him. Why? Because there's a miscommunication on defense when they run the switch release, and both corners try to run with Garrett. Not only does this get Gipson wide open, but him going outside freezes the nickel corner, allowing Garrett to get inside and use his speed to get to the back pylon for a touchdown. Boyle makes the correct decision to throw this ball, but even if that wasn't open, he'd have a wide open TD anyway if he came to the back side. It's a perfect example of how these switch releases can affect a defense and scheme guys open without having to rely solely on their ability to separate.\n\n[2nd and 10 from the NYJ 36](https://streamable.com/xfzzub)\n\nAnd now we're back to the same old go-out concept that we must run at least 5 or 6 times a game. The Dolphins are effectively in prevent defense at this point, with a soft Cover 4 shell and a nickel corner overtop of Garrett Wilson. There is a great opportunity to give him a route where he can stem outside and break to the post, run a juke route, a return or whip route, anything to maximize his separation ability and get him the ball going upfield. What he does instead is run a 5 yard out and get tackled immediately. The problem here isn't necessarily the route, although I could think of several better choices. It's that Tim Boyle puts no zip on this ball and Garrett has to come back to the line of scrimmage to catch it. And I don't necessarily blame Boyle for that - everyone knows he doesn't have that kind of arm talent. If you watch elite route runners across the league like Davante Adams, Keenan Allen, or Christian McCaffrey, you'll see tons of underneath double moves designed to get them the ball in space moving up the field. With Garrett Wilson, who is up there with some of the best separators in the league, it feels like he has to work so much harder for those kinds of passes.\n\n---\n\nSo we have two elite playmakers (and I would say a good tight end as well in Conklin) that you could argue would start on almost every team in the league. But we seem to do as little as possible to maximize their talents and instead just rely purely on their ability. That's a luxury for an NFL team to have for sure, but good scheming can get so much more out of that ability. Here are some examples of Miami doing just that. Obviously they have weapons across the board and Tua is a far better QB than Tim Boyle or Zach Wilson, but this kind of offense still works with less talented players.\n\n[3rd and 8 from the MIA 28](https://streamable.com/xm3ch9)\n\nThis doesn't look like anything special from a scheme perspective, but it's a case of putting your best player in the best position you can. Tyreek Hill is in the slot against DJ Reed, and the Jets are in a dream coverage for the route concept they're running. Press man across the board with a single high safety is as clear of a Cover 1 look as you can give, and Jordan Whitehead, the high safety, is even bracketing Jaylen Waddle instead of playing a true deep zone. Tua has all the room in the world to throw this ball, and with Hill's speed, it turns into a huge gain. Sometimes, the best offense is simple.\n\n[3rd and 2 from the NYJ 29](https://streamable.com/qrglvw)\n\nThis is a beautifully designed screen pass to Tyreek Hill. The Dolphins line up in a 3x1 formation, and DJ Reed is again in press coverage overtop of Hill. Instead of running the screen like that, he comes in on a fast motion, which accomplishes a couple things. First, it gets Reed moving backwards and out of position to press, so that he can't beat a block to the outside to make a play on the screen. Second, it puts Hill closer to both the QB and the offensive line, so not only is it a shorter throw, but the linemen don't have very far to run when making their blocks. The result is that the Dolphins blockers outnumber the Jets defenders on that side, and they rip off another huge gain. Compare that screen pass to [this one](https://streamable.com/o8wn28) the Jets ran against Buffalo, both against press coverage - it's just better design and execution across the board.\n\n[2nd and goal from the NYJ 7](https://streamable.com/cnuof4)\n\nOn the first drive in a goal-to-go situation, Miami lined Tyreek Hill up out wide and threw a fade that went incomplete. This time, they line him up in the backfield. With the Jets in man coverage, this changes the matchup from Sauce Gardner to Jordan Whitehead. Braxton Berrios, the receiver on the same side as Hill, runs a stop route designed to force Whitehead to go around it, giving Hill room to catch and make a move, which he does for the touchdown. It's a poor tackle attempt from Whitehead first of all, but this flat is the exact same route that the Jets tried to have Breece Hall run on that third down later in the game. The difference is not only that Tua gives him a better ball, but it happens so much quicker. \n\n[2nd and 5 from the MIA 23](https://streamable.com/hsflxl)\n\nThe Dolphins run this play a ton. It's not what you would think of as a true downfield RPO, as Tua isn't really reading a defender post-snap. But check out how many shifts and motions the Dolphins do here. The Jets defense is moving all over the place, and it's obvious they're in zone coverage, likely a Cover 4 judging by the DB shell. When Tua hits his back foot, it's just a two man route, but they're both wide open. He hits Jaylen Waddle on a glance for 15 yards and a first down. Not only does the pre-snap movement help Tua determine where he's going with this ball while barely needing to process the defense post-snap, but it capitalizes on his ability to process the defense with a route downfield, a route in the flat, and a run option if he didn't like the matchup against the pass. We can't replicate this exactly as the Dolphins do it with our lack of talent, but downfield RPOs are a staple of the most successful offenses in the NFL, and are completely absent from our playbook.\n\n[3rd and 3 from the MIA 27](https://streamable.com/flmeu3)\n\nAnother simple concept that complements the Dolphins scheme and maximizes their players' abilities. Tyreek Hill lines up in basically a wing position on the right side, and runs a fast motion to the left. The Dolphins run this motion a lot with Hill - sometimes they throw him the ball in the flat or on a screen, sometimes they use it to clear out the middle of the field and throw behind it, and sometimes they use it as a decoy to run to the other side. Here, they just flip him the ball and trust that he'll be able to use his speed to beat Jermaine Johnson to the edge, even adding a run fake to the back to stop JJ from flying up the field. Unsurprisingly, this picks up the first down and a lot more. But it also gives defenses another thing to think about, so next time they see that motion, they're unsure if he'll get the ball or if it's just a decoy.\n\n[3rd and 7 from the NYJ 43](https://streamable.com/nev0kq)\n\nOn a third and long on one of the last drives of the game, the Dolphins line up in a 2 back formation that eventually turns into a 3x1 with Raheem Mostert on the strong side in the backfield. When Jordan Whitehead goes with the fullback on the motion, Tua knows it's man coverage, and by putting a 4th eligible receiver on that side in Mostert, they force the Jets to overload that side defensively - after they're set, the Jets have just three players to the left of the center. This is probably a screen-run option with a bubble to Tyreek Hill, but it's an easy run read to give it to Mostert on the left side. Another wrinkle that the Dolphins throw in is to have Jaylen Waddle, the one receiver on the left, come all the way in to block Quincy Williams. Since DJ Reed is on him in man coverage, the Dolphins effectively get a 2-for-1 block there, and then they have 3 offensive linemen against 2 defensive linemen, and Ashtyn Davis has to come from the deep safety spot to make the tackle after the sticks.\n\n---\n\nIf you want my thoughts after watching this game, I think Tim Boyle is worse than Zach Wilson, and the only thing he does better is throw hot. We have one starting caliber offensive lineman in Joe Tippmann, who also made plenty of negative plays. Max Mitchell had one of the worst games I've ever watched from a tackle and does not look roster-able, Carter Warren is nowhere near ready to start, and Xavier Newman looks like what we'd expect when we got him off a practice squad. We still have no receiver depth, although I thought Brownlee and Gipson looked at least competent. So just to be clear, there is no offensive coordinator in the world that could make this Jets offense look like the Dolphins offense. \n\nHowever, what we do have is three guys who all have legitimate arguments as top 15, if not top 10, players at their positions in Breece Hall, Garrett Wilson, and Tyler Conklin. The entire offense should be focused on getting the ball to those three guys. And I don't mean just line them up and let them do their thing, I mean scheme them open. Have Garrett Wilson run in motion to a bunch, then run a switch release where he comes inside and breaks out against a guy with inside leverage. Run two clearout routes and send Breece on an angle or choice route in that vacated space. If you know they're in man and you like the matchup, let Conklin run one of those juke routes or underneath double moves [that he cooked the Broncos with](https://twitter.com/Joerb31/status/1712083375144706344) (and that we've barely seen since then). But these static-formation, straight line routes are not it.\n\nYou can see from watching the Dolphins offense that while some players might be good enough to make plays, a good complementary scheme can make it better. Motions and shifts affect defenses and make it easier to diagnose coverage, bring defenders away from an area on the field that you want to attack, and get your playmakers in better positions to get the ball and make plays. Downfield RPOs can not only help the QB by giving them an easy read and completion, but also give the offensive line a numbers advantage against a defense that isn't flying downhill right off the snap. And if you ask guys to do things that they are simply not capable of, like a small receiver blocking an edge rusher, don't be surprised when they fail at that.\n\nBottom line - just because Garrett Wilson is good enough to get a clean release on a slant against Jalen Ramsey in press coverage doesn't mean we have to make him do that.", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.999}, {"ranking": 0.38235294117647056, "comments": "Jets Sign CB Anthony Brown Release CB Craig James We don\u2019t need CB help but this is definitely an interesting signing \n\n\nBrown (5-11, 196) played in 2 games for the 49ers this season and only took 3 snaps on special teams.

Fashanu and Alt were gone by 8. \n\n**1.24) WR Emeka Egbuka, Ohio St-  6\u20191\u201d 205** \n\n* GW was a hit, so why not try another ohio st receiver. Very explosive, fluid, flexible, with good vertical speed. High IQ and can work through zone coverages, also has snappy suddenness and awareness to win in man. Has the full route tree and complete skill set to be employed in countless ways including on the boundary, in the slot and on gadget plays. \n\n**2.46) OT Jordan Morgan, Arizona- 6\u20196\u201d 320** \n\n* Tore his acl in Nov 2022 after having an all conference season. Came back this year week 1 and has picked up right where he left off. Great footwork in pass pro, very strong, high level athlete, light feet, good flexibility, 3 year starter at LT. Well balanced blocker in the pass and run game. \n\n**2.48) OG Graham Barton, Duke- 6\u20195\u201d 315** \n\n* Very high effort, high IQ, mechanically sound, rep finisher, strong and decent mobility. 34+ starts at LT but should move to guard. His QB said \u201carguably the hardest football player that we have, the hardest worker on the field and off the field\u201d \n\n**3.74) DT Michael Hall Jr, Ohio St- 6\u20192\u201d 285** \n\n* Slightly undersized but has room to add weight, and is the perfect skillset for a 3tech in our scheme. Explosive, strong, athletic, with an incredible burst. DT depth is needed behind Q. \n\n**3.95) WR Tory Horton, Colorado St- 6\u20192\u201d 190** \n\n* My Sleeper alert pick, reminds me of St Brown. Small school but a very smooth operator, a glider with a long body, has a great understanding of how to attack leverages and openings in zones, quick change of direction, reliable hands, boundary and slot versatility. \n\n**4.104) QB Michael Pratt, Tulane- 6\u20193\u201d 220** \n\n* Viewed as a high floor/low ceiling guy. Does everything right, but not going to wow you with any extraordinary abilities. Small school, 4 year starter with a jump in production from year 2 to 3, and is the main reason Tulane football is on the map right now. They have a 23-3 record the past 2 years and beat USC last year in their bowl game. Good size and thickness to him. Can push the ball to all levels of the field, very accurate in the intermediate area and displays nice touch, throws with excellent timing and rhythm, anticipates windows and leverages very well, high football IQ. A very functional and decently athletic runner too who can escape to throw on the run, plus easily run for 1st downs. I want the guy with intangibles through the roof to learn behind Rodgers for 1-2 years. \n\n**5.170) OT/OG Matt Goncalves, Pitt- 6\u20196\u201d 330**\n\n* Experienced player with an eerily similar path as Carter Warren in that they are both from NY, both played tackle for Pitt, and both could have turned pro but came back and got season ending injuries only a few games into their last season. Large size, well built, well rounded blocker with good technique, strong, versatile with swing tackle potential or guard.

The trades aren't super explorable, but they aren't terrible. I know we still have several weeks of live football to look forward too, and this MOCK is only if the order stays the same. I truly hope we win anywhere between one and to three more games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFull Mock: [https://www.nflmockdraftdatabase.com/user-mock-drafts/2024/user-mock-1821865](https://www.nflmockdraftdatabase.com/user-mock-drafts/2024/user-mock-1821865)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1.02 - Marvin Harrison JR, WR - As if this needed any explanation. Is MHJ the prince that was promised? If Michael Wilson can develop into a strong hands guy, and we can utilize Rondale Moore in the short game - we could put Marquise on the deep routes he was always meant to succeed at without being a high volume guy. MHJ could be the reliable 150+ target hog that Kyler adores. Between MHJ Michael Wilson and Trey Mcbride our receiving corp would theoretically be hard to stop. Scheme is the biggest question.\n\n1.21 - Kalen King, CB - Clearly our biggest issue on defense is our ability to defend the pass and not have wide receivers and tight ends running rampant. Kalen King is an enforcer at CB with reliable hands.\n\n  \n2.14 (46 Overall) Kris Jenkins, IDL - Between BJ Ojulari, Zaven Collins, and Dennis Gardeck - along with a solid scheme, we may have solved some of the pass rush problems. However, teams have been able to run all over us. Ideally a big bodied interior defensive linemen to cover some gaps would help anchor some of the weakness.\n\n3.02 (64 Overall) Sedrick Van Pran, IOL - Offensive Line depth always seems like something that comes up. Pressure from the middle is hard to deal with, and while we may have gotten our anchor eventually on the left with Paris Johnson JR this last draft. I think SVP would be a great addition to our line. He's a proven winner coming from the Georgia Oline\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.08 (70 Overall) Ruke Orhorhoro, IDL - I think the best defensive schemes in football right now have a plethora of good-great defensive lineman they can rotate in and out. I think Monti would want to build our roster from the inside out. From the trenches outward. Gannon schemed up the Eagle's Defense using a rotation of guys. Between Orhorhoro and Jenkins, not to mention the guys on the roster already we could have a strong from that would be harder to run on.\n\n3.16 (78 Overall) Tommy Eichenberg, ILB - Someone needs to be able to come in behind these big bodied defensive linemen and make the tackles. Eichenberg has traditional size and is a multi year starter for the Buckeyes and should have good instincts for the NFL.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3.24 (86 Overall) Braelon Allen, RB - Whenever James Conner has to miss games due to injury we never seem to have a good back to be able to be the bruiser we want them to be. Braelon Allen graduated HS early to play college ball early. He has good hands when given the opportunity and has amazing size and speed. This last year in college has been kind of a disappointment where he was one of the best backs in the nation when he was only 18. If he could recapture the magic behind an NFL line it could make for an amazing combo.\n\n5.06 (133 Overall) Khyree Jackson, CB - He is a large, fast, fluid player who could defend passes against taller competition. Could be a depth piece, could be a starter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.11 (138 Overall) Javion Cohen, IOL - He is a bit light and might have trouble against some of the pass rushers in the NFC west, but has played multiple roles along the offensive line. Some of our current starters are getting up there in age and it would not be a bad thing to begin transitioning and preparing for the future.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5.32 (159 Overall) Julian Pearl, OT - With picks these late we are hoping for solid depth pieces. At 6'6 Julian Pearl is a big big man with great length and maneuverability. He helped lead his team to one of the top rushing attacks in their conference. Has started 11 out of 12 games at Left Tackle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6.09 (168 Overall) Zy Alexander, CB - Another large, fast CB. Two years removed from a six interception season. The man has great hands and can tackle well.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n7.32 (224 Overall) Tykee Smith, S - I think we should be looking for starters in every round of the draft. Tykee Smith could be a great piece to swap in and out in the Nickel defense. Could be a reliable starter if others get injured.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9982}, {"ranking": 0.2647058823529412, "comments": "With the Chiefs scoring zero today, Arizona is no longer the worst second half offense in the NFL.

Panthers are terrible. Giants are feisty but not good. Buccs are decent but that\u2019s in Lambeau, odds are Packers win. Packers not only control their own destiny, but the path to the playoffs for everyone below them because of their H2H wins over LA and the Saints who are below them with games vs the Buccs and Vikings on deck.\n\nUnless the Saints win out, or the Seahawks shock a few teams, Packers are the Odds on favorite to make the playoffs not just as the 7th seed, but the 6th seed. Which means a likely rematch at Ford Field vs the Lions. Who haven\u2019t won a playoff game in decades.\n\nGo Pack Go!", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9411}, {"ranking": 0.5454545454545454, "comments": "Kenny Clark sending the Lions right guard to the shadow realm ", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.5454545454545454, "comments": "Montanan heading to Green Bay for Sunday\u2019s game.

Daniel Whelan, punter, Green Bay. Four punts in Detroit Thursday, four inside the 20-yard line. They landed at the 16-, 3-, 9- and 9-yard line of the Lions, and only one resulted in a Detroit scoring drive. Whelan\u2019s a great story. He grew up in Ireland, and moved to the United States when his mom, who worked in the hotel business, got a job at a Ritz-Carlton Hotel in California. A football coach saw him booming kicks as a center fullback and asked if he could try kicking a football. He hit a 52-yard field goal, and one day hit the crossbar from 65 yards out. A prospect was born.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t have written it up any better,\u201d Whelan said recently. \u201cI just love football. I went to a lot of kicking camps once I got to the U.S., and I concentrated on looking at the competition and just trying to be better than the other guys wherever I went. I think it\u2019s possible there can be more kickers and punters from Ireland, if they\u2019re willing to put in the time, the effort and constantly work on their craft.\u201d He\u2019s 22nd in gross punting, with a 46.8-yard average. His net average, 38.9 yards, isn\u2019t good. But he\u2019s had only five touchbacks in 45 punts.\n\nAs for what Whelan thinks of Green Bay: \u201cI love it.

We do have head to head victories over both, but in a multi way tie that includes the Ravens, it would go to conference record first. For that very reason, a Jaguars loss to an AFC team carries slightly more weight than a Dolphins loss to an NFC team. Additionally, the Jaguars have the easier schedule than the Dolphins after this week, so it's slightly more important for them to get their loss here.\n\n4: RAMS beat Browns\n\n5: CARDINALS beat Steelers\n\nThe Browns and Steelers aren't incredibly threatening, but they are only a game behind the Chiefs in the conference standings, so a loss for both would be nice. A Cardinals win would be the slightly less nice outcome of the two, because it comes with the drawback of helping the Patriots in the Caleb Williams sweepstakes. Speaking of which ...\n\n6: PATRIOTS beat Chargers\n\nRoot against a divisional rival and hurt the Patriots' draft positioning? Yes please!\n\n7: BUCCANEERS beat Panthers\n\n8: FALCONS beat Jets\n\n9: COLTS beat Titans\n\nAgain, we need all the teams at the bottom of the standings to lose in order to keep Caleb Williams away from the Patriots. The Panthers (or rather, the Bears) have the top spot as of right now. Of the other two games, a Jets loss is slightly more likely to be helpful, as they actually play the Patriots later in the year.\n\n10: TEXANS beat Broncos\n\nBoth teams are 6-5, but a Texans win puts them closer to knocking the Jaguars out of the division lead, and they're more dangerous than either team in this game. Even if the Jaguars do win the division, the Texans are more likely than the Broncos to knock out a contender in the wild card round.\n\n11: SEAHAWKS beat Cowboys\n\nWe have the Cowboys' 5th round pick.\n\n12: SAINTS beat Lions\n\nA Lions loss hurts the Ravens' strength of victory (although it does carry the drawback of possibly helping to put their 1st round pick ahead of ours if we're eliminated in the same round of the playoffs as they are).\n\n13: 49ERS beat Eagles\n\nWhereas a Lions loss could hurt our draft pick, a 49ers win helps our draft pick for the same reason.\n\nBYES: Ravens, Bills, Bears, Raiders, Vikings, Giants", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9501}, {"ranking": 0.7941176470588235, "comments": "What do Chiefs fans want for Christmas?

A growing list of teams appears to be in need of a head coach, and I suspect we'll see even more once the season wraps up. If you don't hire him, someone else will.\n\nI recently watched Greg Olsen's interview with Rich Eisen, where he expressed significant interest in becoming this team's next head coach. Many here love Olsen, but some doubt his coaching experience for a proper head coach role. A common comparison I see is that he'd be the next Jeff Saturday\u2014a sports commentator turned coach who failed. I disagree with this take, believing there are several key differences that would separate the failure we saw with Jeff Saturday as the Colts' interim head coach and a potential Greg Olsen-led Panthers.\n\nFirst, it's crucial to acknowledge that Jeff Saturday was thrown into arguably the worst situation an interim head coach can be put in. The Colts' last season was a dumpster fire. They brought in Matt Ryan, hoping to recreate the magic of Tom Brady with the Bucs and Matt Stafford with the Rams. Despite decent success in previous seasons, the plan failed as Matt Ryan was washed, and the Colts seemingly regressed significantly. Saturday was thrown into the position last minute. Coaching experience would have been extremely helpful, but he was thrust in mid-season, dealing with a team falling apart. In contrast, Greg Olsen would have an entire offseason to prepare and adjust the roster.\n\nAnother advantage Olsen would have over a guy like Saturday is that Olsen retired fairly recently. Saturday had been out of the NFL for close to 10 years, and the game had changed dramatically since his time. Olsen likely has a better understanding of how the modern game works. Being an analyst, he has observed how all teams operate, understanding what successful teams are doing and what failing teams are missing, all from a natural bird's-eye view.\n\nThe most critical aspect of hiring a head coach, in my opinion, is finding someone who can build a positive culture. When we first hired Dan Campbell, many mocked his \"knee caps\" comment at his first press conference. However, that culture of never giving up has helped us (at least for now) no longer be among the worst teams in the league. Culture building is probably the most important aspect of the head coach's job.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying Olsen is the best person available for the job, but he certainly is not the worst option.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9399}, {"ranking": 0.21212121212121213, "comments": "Cam at Barstool Its not panther related per say but its been fun watching all the stuff coming out of barstool with cam in it this week.

Probably much ado about nothing - but it raised an eyebrow. \n\n2. I am in a section which has always came with lot 1 parking - until this next year under their new contract terms if I sign. I will be given the option to buy a pass to each game from here on out I suppose. That is an added expense I haven't paid for before out of pocket.

Because what new HC would not want to come in and either call plays himself or bring in his own guy, especially after the product we put on the field this year. And what OTHER team would watch our offense and go, \u201cyeah, I need some of THAT in my life.\u201d\n\nSo, to me, despite the season being lost in terms of playoff chances, Thomas Brown is going to be fighting for his (immediate) future as a play caller. If he wants to keep this job, or get another offer as an OC in the league next year, he\u2019s going to have to not just \u201csink or swim\u201d but it\u2019s like he\u2019s in a \u201csink or fly a rocket ship to the moon\u201d type of situation.\n\nIf I\u2019m Thomas Brown, Bryce Young\u2019s development isn\u2019t even my #1 priority anymore\u2014I don\u2019t have that luxury.

Yes, Rock Hill was a mess. Yes the turf sucks. \n\nYes Rhule was a swing and a miss, and the 7-year contract was stupid. But given my understanding of linear time, we didn\u2019t know he wasn\u2019t going to work out when hired and he was a hot prospective candidate. I think Tepper was reasonably patient but after 2.5 years realized it wasn\u2019t working and moved on. \n\nReally seems like he learned from the Rhule fiasco and went in the other direction. Brought in a coaching staff that on paper was amazing. Tons of experience. We have a great special teams coordinator (or did until a few days ago), a great defensive coordinator, and an up and coming OC who worked under a proven and successful system. Reich was not the most inspired choice as HC but he brought a lot of these guys in and seemed like a reasonable choice at the time. \n\nIt didn\u2019t work out, and he has again moved on. \n\n\nOh. And the notion that he forced Frank Reich to take BY in the draft is 1. A rumor 2. Stupid. Young was QB 1 for tons of analysts and scouts and was highly coveted by a lot of teams. Even people who had Stroud first acknowledged BY was a great prospect and many had it ranked has 1a and 1b rather than a true 1 and 2. \n\nClearly the results haven\u2019t been good, and that\u2019s reason enough to be skeptical of Tepper as an owner. But it\u2019s crazy to me that people are acting like the guy isn\u2019t trying to win. He\u2019s clearly throwing a ton of money and effort in to try and find success. \n\nI don\u2019t care about David Tepper and am not defending him, his tenure as an owner speaks for itself. But honestly I don\u2019t get the degree of hostility. After his first couple of years as an owner it seems like he\u2019s making good and reasonable hiring decisions that just haven\u2019t hit yet. Kinda feel bad for the guy honestly lol.", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9964}, {"ranking": 0.21212121212121213, "comments": "Cam Newton thinks Tepper wants Belichick.

I think Tepper is showing a little more humility now and he'll likely take this years criticisms and adjust for the next.

This is in no way in defense of Tepper, or minimizing some of the amazing things our team has accomplished in such a short time frame. This is just to put things into perspective. \n\nIn our 29 years of existence, we have NEVER had back to back winning seasons. The closest we\u2019ve come was in \u201806 &amp; \u201809 where we went 8-8. But not a single time was our team able to string together winning seasons. \n\nYes, we saw instant success in \u201896 where we were a game out of the Super Bowl, but we also spent 6 seasons in a row after that without a single winning record season. \n\nIn fact we have had 7 winning seasons in our 29 years of existence. Just think about that for a minute. In the 23 years before Tepper purchased the team, we had 7 winning seasons combined through 4 different head coaching programs. \n\nJohn Fox and Ron Rivera only had 3 winning seasons each as head coaches. Each were here 9 years and only put together a winning season 3 times. \n\nRecord aside, our team consistently let big players walk for free in free agency. We had Gettleman who was proud of the fact that he doesn\u2019t play hardball with players and consistently shops in the \u201cbargain bin\u201d for players. He was so proud of it that he destroyed relationships with Panther legends just to get it done. \n\nMany of us are annoyed and upset with how our team has been in the last 6 years, and it\u2019s understandable. But let\u2019s stop pretending like it\u2019s all Teppers fault. Our team has never really done what needs to be done to become a consistent winning organization. Again, im not defending Tepper, im just pointing out that this is a history of being trash. It takes a minute to turn that entire culture around. At the very least, we can say that unlike Jerry, Tepper isn\u2019t afraid to spend the money to make it happen and has done whatever he can to rebuild the relationships with Panther legends.", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9962}, {"ranking": 0.21212121212121213, "comments": "[Panthers] Julius Peppers, Steve Smith Sr. on Hall of Fame semifinalist list ", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.4404}, {"ranking": 0.21212121212121213, "comments": "Yep!

Frank had clearly earned another few years to putter around. Just look how much week-to-week improvement I assume there has been. He's been firing so many coaches lately. That's a problem! Obviously, the problem isn't hiring terrible head coaches, it's firing terrible head coaches. Plus, he didn't even keep around any of the interim head coaches! As we all know that happens all the time in the NFL!\n\nAlso Bryce Young is short! Have you seen him? He's, like, so short! And as we all know that is the one statistic that matters for quarterback analysis.  Just look at future hall-of-fame quarterbacks like Paxton Lynch (6' 7\") and JaMarcus Russell (6' 6\"). And let's not even get into the titan that was 6' 8\" Dan McGwire, an all-time GOAT if ever there was one. There is no need to dig deeper into quarterback play. Football is a notoriously solo sport that is entirely determined by height. However, I think the real nail in the coffin is that no player has ever bounced back from a rough rookie season. Ever!

To the top of the screen we have a dig and a chip-release flare out of the backfield. This concept is a full field read from right to left (or bottom to top) but I can explain that more in a minute.\n\nThe defense is presenting a single high safety look, typically going to result in cover 3 or cover 1 (man coverage with a deep middle safety). The tight alignment of the CBs when combined with the single high look from the safety seems to suggest Cover 1 but CBs can always bail out of a press look just to throw you off so you can\u2019t assume.\n\nHere\u2019s a detailed breakdown of how Bryce\u2019s 3 second progression most likely went to turn this into a first down:\n\n1a. Eyes go to the high-low concept against the boundary CB lined up over Mingo. If the CB bails (like he would in cover 3 or 4), take the hitch for the first down. If a hang defender takes this away, skip past 1a straight to 2. CB sat on hitch, so instead go to 1a.\n\n1b. If the boundary CB sits on the hitch, the deep third is vacated and you\u2019ve got a realistic shot at a TD to Chark. You\u2019ve got a slot CB in a tough matchup with a lot of empty space that you can use to throw Chark open regardless of what leverage he gets on the CB. Gets over the top? Cool. Throw it over the top. CB is playing over the top? Cool, throw it back shoulder. Only way this doesn\u2019t work, when 1a also doesn\u2019t work is if a safety rotates back to play that area and sits over top. And this is the moment when Bryce notices that Titans were in fact disguising their coverage with a single high look, before dropping a safety AND a LB into deep coverage, making this now Tampa 2 coverage\u2014a wildly different coverage than we anticipated.\n\n2. Thielen\u2019s Stick route.\n\nA stick route is pretty much just about finding space and sitting down and the sticks (get where the name comes from?). If the #1 defender (the boundary CB) and the #2 defender (the slot CB) both took away those routes, then there is room on the outside for Thielen to work back towards after settling down at the sticks, and leverage is there against an inside aligned MLB. But that isn\u2019t what happens here. Instead, the slot CB is responsible for the hook zone (inside the flats) which allows him to leave Chark for the safety, and subsequently, squeeze down the stick route from the outside while the linebacker does the same from the inside. So this 3rd read isn\u2019t open either.\n\n3. We\u2019re now on to the backside dig, and working your way all the way to this point in the progression is a feat in and of itself. I mean, look what it took us just to get here.\n\nAnd yet, there are still problems. Against typical 2 high safety looks like cover 2 or cover 4, then a backside dig is a good answer. Not so much against Tampa 2. The difference is the LB who is tasked with taking away the middle of the field underneath the safeties\u2026the exact place where this route is designed to go (TEN was really in the perfect coverage against this play).\n\nSo what does Bryce do? If you watch closely, he manipulates MULTIPLE defenders with his eyes and pump fake and CREATES the window for this throw.\n\nThe pump fake to Thielen holds the inside leveraged underneath zone defender, and draws the deep Tampa coverage backer towards Theien and out of his zone. But there is still a hook defender on the left side of the field that is making life difficult so, if you watch the second angle closely, you\u2019ll notice that Bryce shifts his body and his eyes towards Chuba out of the backfield. He didn\u2019t want to check it down on 4th and 4\u2013but this subtle eye trickery moved the hook defender out of HIS zone to take Chuba (even though Chuba should be the CBs responsibility at this point). Bryce then rips a throw, BEFORE Sullivan even crosses the safety\u2019s face because he KNOWS the coverage and where the space is in between zones.\n\nAfter watching this back and breaking it down, this play was IMMACULATE, and I am absolutely stoked that we have a QB that can make this play.\n\n", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9967}, {"ranking": 0.21212121212121213, "comments": "Give Tepper a break From the outside looking in Panthers fans look impossible in to appease.

I was all in on getting AR predraft, he was my guy, and I\u2019m a UK fan who watched Levis make our football team fun to watch for a couple years. After the draft the conversation got pretty annoying and even downright awful a lot of times, I had a family member say they were mad we took him because he \u201clooked like a thug\u201d. \n\nAR was one of the most hotly debated 50/50 boom or bust prospects I can remember. Everyone who follows the NFL had a pretty strong opinion on him preseason. The fact that he looked so good so fast in his limited time, coupled with the fact that Gardner has had some struggles and generally not been the same level of player he was at Jax or Philly, is gonna lead to some victory lapping. With as crappy as the training camp conversations were it\u2019s extremely vindicating to us Richardson ride-or-dies. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s played super well, but I think it\u2019s been good enough. Most times it feels like we\u2019re playing good in spite of him and not because of him. The turnovers are bad, and his pocket presence is abysmal at times, which is arguably Richardsons greatest trait. He\u2019s great with the RPO plays though, and he\u2019s been good at getting the ball in the hands of our best skill players and letting them work.\n\nAt the end of the day, me and everyone else who were in the Richardson camp preseason are still rooting for Gardner. He\u2019s quarterbacking our best team in a few years, and we know he\u2019s capable of playing solid football. I\u2019d love nothing more than for him to throw for 300 and 3 on Sunday and beat the breaks off the Tits. But we\u2019re also feeling pretty convinced that we were in the right in the offseason, and we\u2019re gonna victory lap a bit, Gardner is mostly just collateral damage. \n\nTL;DR: Minshew hate is mostly a byproduct of the Richardson v. Minshew starter debates from preseason. We\u2019re still rooting for him to play well, but Richardson fans feel vindicated that we were right about a pretty contentious topic. Dogpiling is mostly just to make it clear to other Colts and NFL fans that minshew is not as good as AR.

Phantom false start sets back Seattle on first drive (Zero affect on game overall)\n\n2. 3rd and 16, blatant hold on Jarran Reed, Dallas gets first down instead of 3rd and 26 (drive results in a TD) \n\n3. Riq Woolen has a questionable PI call, gives Dallas a first down and essentially a TD\n\n4. Pete Carroll calls timeout before delay of game, is ignored, fg is then missed. \n\n5. Dallas has back to back 10 yard penalties picked up, without any replay, keeps the drive moving, but were not essential to the drive imo\n\n6. Stephon Gilmore gets called for DPI, right call but a weak call, still stronger than Woolens call tho, gives Seahawks 7. \n\n7. CeeDee pushes off on Woolen. WOOLEN is called for DPI, first down Dallas, doesn\u2019t affect game too much. \n\n8. Dallas gets fresh set of downs on bs PI call on Wagner IN THE RED ZONE. Gives Dallas fg. \n\n9.  Jake Ferguson catch and run to Seattle 4. Block in the back prevents play from being blown up. \n\n10. Jarran Reed held again on 3rd and 5. Sets up 4 and 2 which is converted, drive results in fg.\n\n11. Deejay Dallas facemask. PICKED UP. Zero affect on game. \n\n12. Woolen called for DPI for touching CeeDees shoulder. 40 yards. Free TD\n\n13. Parsons offsides on 3 and 10. Next play is that 4 and 1 where Charb got stuffed and hurt. \n\n14. Jake Ferguson GW touchdown is blatant opi and pushoff.

What a complete breakdown on primetime. I was praising the defense last week for their heart and mentality, but they got beat down and then some. \n\nDC: Clint Hurtt: What are you doing? I was kinda praising you last week for coaching a good group of guys, but they did not show up on primetime. Pass rush is definitely better under Hurtt compared to years past, however, his job is under scrutiny as of now. Dallas offense played a hell of a game, and the refs controlled the entire outcome, but 42 points allowed is 42 points allowed. Not excusable. \n\nDefensive Line: \n\nBoye Mafe: The offsides prevented a Seahawks pick that would've flipped the game upside down for us. He's had a great season and was getting pressure on Dak this game, but that mistake cost the team too much. \n\nLeonard Wiliams: The loss stings, so people won't see William's impact as much, but he's been great on this d-line. That Cowboys interior is elite, with Zack Martin and Tyler Smith in there, but he was bringing heat this game. \n\nDre'Mont Jones: What does bro do. Didn't see him make any impact on the game. Cowboys O-Line is great, but after getting this big of a contract, this shouldn't happen\n\nDarrell Taylor: Why is he still on the team. Had a sack, sure, but Dak sonned him. If he got the sack, that would've been a long 3rd down and the momentum would've changed. Can get a much better, more upside edge in the draft. Really miss Nwosu when it comes to these situations. \n\nLBS: \n\nBobby Wagner: Made great run stops, but that PI on Pollard was complete BS by the refs. Was also AGAIN a liability in coverage, giving up a Brandin Cooks TD and 2 point conversion. We need a linebacker in the draft who's good at coverage and can get coached up by him. \n\nJordyn Brooks: The reason we lost this game, but not in a bad way. He was balling before he got hurt, consistently getting pressure and prevented key Dallas drives. Once he got hurt, the defense started crumbling. Hopefully the injury is not that serious. \n\nDevin Bush: Got to see more action from him today, and honestly, he didn't do bad. Was better in coverage than I expected. Did good\n\nCBS: \n\nRiq Woolen: Did TERRIBLY the first half, was consistently giving up key plays and was a liability, but stepped it up the second half. That second PI penalty on him for touching CeeDee's shoulder was the most BS PI penalty since the 2018 NFC Championship Game. Penalized all over the place, but was okay for the most part. \n\nDevon Witherspoon: Probably his worst game of the season. Didn't do terrible, and that's saying something. Can't have them all, but we needed this win. Made a couple of splash plays as he always does but CeeDee cooked him, and I'll give him that. \n\nTre Brown: Penalized all over the place as well. Not too much to say about him, had a bad game like the entire secondary. \n\nSafeties: \n\nQuandre Diggs: Liability in coverage, as usual and so bad at tackling it doesn't even make sense. Need to move on from him after this season. Too much of a cap hit for too little production. \n\nJulian Love: Horrible coverage, but was the best of the three safeties, ironically. \n\nJamal Adams: The player I'm most mad at. I was so stoked when he came over from the Jets in that trade. After 2019 where we almost made the NFC Championship game, I was like, \"This might finally get us over the hump.\" Did okay in 2020, then disappeared after that. I still had a little hope for him after the last analysis but this game made me lose all of it. He got thorougly whooped by Jake Ferguson, then proceeds to insult a reporter's wife for calling him out. After playing a bad game, you're going to get criticism. It's up to you whether to handle it with class or go full Antonio Brown. Jamal chose the latter, more immature route. After the reporter incident, I think we thoroughly need to move on from him.

If you didn't see my last post analyzing our offense and defense, you can check it out by going to my profie, but here's another one after the Dallas game. Defense in a separate post\n\nShane Waldron: Man the offense turned it around, he called a hell of a game. Too bad the defense couldn't hold up. I want to see more consistency from him calling multiple games like this, but with your job getting jeopardized, way to step it up. Just wish he didn't call a handoff to Charbonnet on a 4th and 1 when the Dallas defense was stopping the run all game.\n\nQB: \n\nGeno Smith: Way to step it up. He was DEALING in the dallas game, consistently making throw after throw. The 73 yard TD to DK was amazing and the throw to JSN which didn't count as a touchdown was a thing of beauty. Also was mobile in the pocket for the first time since last year. Hate to see his performance go to waste by losing. \n\nRBS: \n\nKenneth Walker III: Obviously didn't play, but with Abe Lucas coming back, this makes me STOKED to see what he can do. \n\nZach Charbonnet: Really really impressive performance as a rookie against one of the best defenses in the NFL. Took the ball 35 yards on a screen which was big for setting up a DK touchdown. That 1-2 punch with Walker is exciting\n\nWRS: \n\nDK Metcalf: WHAT DID I TELL Y'ALL, check my profie if you think I'm lying. I expected a bigger game for DK but not this big. 6 catches for 133 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was COOKING. I told y'all Geno and DK just needed to put some work in the lab for a bit. I think what lost us the game was not targeting him as much the second half. Reintroduced himself to the world on primetime. \n\nTyler Lockett: NOOO!! I might've jinxed this so I'm really sorry y'all :( Had a decent game other then the drop but that was too much of a mistake. Probably his first big mistake in a while, so give the guy a break. He's still the darling of Seahawks fans. \n\nJaxon Smith Njigba: I told y'all about this too. He proved himself too. I still stand that he caught the ball. Refs really screwed us on that one like they did all game. Still finished with 7 catches for 66 yards regardless. He showed that he'll be a great WR on this offense. \n\nJake Bobo: Guess we forgot about Bobo, hence we lost. Run blocking monster but he can be a reliable target. \n\nTES: \n\nNoah Fant: Much improved performance. The offense is more explosive when the tight ends are used\n\nWill Dissly: Geno threw the ball a little too high on one of his targets. Could've caught the ball, proves to be the most overpaid tight end in football. \n\nOL: \n\nLT: Charles Cross: Didn't have the best game, but still didn't allow any sacks, which is huge. Parsons is a generational player, and the fact the o-line held him to no sacks is impressive. Just that last 4th and 2 play that he had the game-sealing play, which is expected from a guy like him. \n\nLG: Damien Lewis: Surprisingly good job from him, keep it up. \n\nC: Evan Brown: Got called for a phantom false start and was allowing pressures left and right. I know this is statistically the best d-line in football but could've seen more out of him\n\nRG: Anthony Bradford: Run blocking was great, pass blocking was ehh. Promising young guard who looks like a great player. \n\nRT: Abe Lucas: Got him back and what a difference he makes. Other then that miscommunication with Dallas on the last play he was great.  \n\nOverall, stellar performance from the offense, wish they would've gotten that final 2 minute drive, but nonetheless, looks promising.

Regardless of the team, it seems like calls, especially in primetime games, tend to go against whoever has early momentum. I truly don't think there is some big conspiracy to push narratives or exalt certain teams or players, but it would be SO EASY to pay off a few officials to help cover the spread in certain key games. \n\nNow, generally, this would balance out and teams would get kinda screwed at random depending on how things would be going, but one thing that our Hawks have been doing incredibly is coming out swinging lately. In particular, in this game and against the Rams, we've had such a great start and come out with such swagger, just for us to get key penalties against us that have turned momentum in the opponent's favor. We've criticized Pete for a long time for having slow starts to his games, and I'm loving how strong we've been coming out recently, but I think this is one situation where it seems to be working to our disadvantage. \n\nI don't know, but it's what's been on my mind after the last few.

I've also added the tables showing the % of drives ending in an interception. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8h896bixrq3c1.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9af8b72295713fb62083f61dc7689c6f598f4bdd\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjsshupmsq3c1.png?width=567&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=18e561401c8b83bc62d5fb1f7b21d879b73fc3a1\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q9fw3qznsq3c1.png?width=568&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d66a0be2992231b7e5f393a3f624bbcb46eb4ae\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7hcx0tpsq3c1.png?width=566&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d25f3ed9a3312717e1d55d5cdc27932051706dd0\n\n**Interceptions**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Passer *(color on chart)*|Winning by 4+|Score difference between +3 and -3|Losing by 4-8 points|Losing by 9+|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|T.Tagovailoa *(Aqua)*|4%|9%|21%|15%|\n|J.Allen *(Red)*|9%|9%|6%|13%|\n|J.Burrow *(Orange)*|5%|9%|8%|10%|\n|J.Herbert *(Pale Blue)*|5%|7%|12%|12%|\n|J.Hurts *(Green)*|6%|7%|0%|13%|\n|P.Mahomes *(Gold)*|4%|9%|4%|19%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Conclusions**\n\nWhen he's got the lead in the 2nd half, Tua is protecting the ball. He's not leading TD drives as often, but because he doesn't need to. He's got one of the highest winning percentages of this group in these games. A 4+ point lead is basically a lock. Josh Allen has a conspicuously low winning percentage for how often he leads TD drives in these games, but his interception rate is double Tua's and this doesn't include fumbles. \n\nWhen the game is close, he's leading TD drives as much as anyone, a top 5 rate in this time period. That leads to a top 10 winning percentage in those games among this group (**GREAT**). \n\nWhen he's trying to come from behind, he's the quintessential \"gunslinger\". He's throwing an absurd rate of interceptions...but, he's also leading a lot of TD drives. The mix gets us a win \\~40% of the time, which is very good. Burrow and Mahomes leading TD drives 50%+ of the time in these situations matches their reputations (though Burrow has a lower winning percentage in these games than Tua). \n\nWhen losing by 9+ points, you've basically lost the game. Tua is throwing a lot of TD's here, but winning these games only at an average rate. Based on his peers, it seems he's throwing interceptions here at a pretty healthy rate. Mahomes and Hurts are winning at a crazy rate, and Burrow is not far behind, despite not leading TD drives quite as often. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nObviously there's a lot more context to consider, the defenses in this game (both the one the QB is facing and their own) can make a big difference. Skill players make a difference as well. Hurts has a great rushing attack that can salt a game away, Herbert has WRs with no hands sometimes, for example. This includes all of Tua's 2nd half drives, with Flores and McDaniel. **But overall, I'm encouraged to see Tua's aggressiveness seems healthy and leads to wins.** \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9902}, {"ranking": 0.6363636363636364, "comments": "Tyreek did RG3s podcast.

So that\u2019s a total of 81 yards on five drives. \n\nSo what do we know? The Dolphins defense is elite.  In four games, they have defended 40 drives that began on the opponent\u2019s side of the field and given up 28 points. That\u2019s 7 points per game.

Obviously we need fire Pete, and bring in a young, offensive minded HC, a GM who is motivated, and able to make moves. Look at Philly, and the trades and moves they have made. Its not just luck or random, their GM is the reason they are where they are, partly because of stupid ass trades from Mickey. \n\nWe need to fix the cap situation and get rid of older players with bloated contracts.

How can you upgrade here? You guys want to bring in RG3? \n\nAccountability should be held in the offseason. When you can evaluate things rationally and look at options. The team is cash strapped but it has a lot of talent. Which is why we\u2019re all disappointed here, because a lot of talent has equaled middling results. The solution to the problem of firing Carmichael and DA, lies on who can you get to improve this team, who will step in and do a better job. The problem is that both these coaches are amazing for their previous position but both lack an ability for in game adjustments, play calling, awful time clock management and a general inability to close out games. \n\nThe only way forward here is to ride out this season, try to win the South. It\u2019s still VERY DOABLE. In the offseason you try and find a coach that would be an upgrade and if not, unfortunately try again and as we all know, they will suck and we should be on tank-a-thon mode.

KOC play calling:\n\nI totally understand why people are upset for his lack of aggressiveness on that last drive and to some extent I agree. I don\u2019t have an issue running on first down to see what you can get. If you get positive yardage, you set yourself up to run the ball again on 2nd down while forcing the bears to use more timeouts. However when it gets stuffed as it did, you have to pivot to the quick game on 2nd down. Slants, curls, whatever. The bears secondary was playing aggressive all night and you could have used that to your advantage. With all this said I think people need to understand where KOC is coming from. He\u2019s watched his QB have a game in which he has missed wide open reads and throws, and should have had like 6 INTS. People are also saying they didn\u2019t call designed runs, but the bears played great containment and forced Dobbs to make reads and throws from the pocket which didn\u2019t happen.\n\n2. Defense: \n\nThe defense played amazing all night long forcing screens and checkdown which were held in check for the most part. My only issue was on that final drive we only rushed 3/4 when the stacking the box was effective all night.\n\n3. Going forward: \n\nI believe that we will see Hall coming off the bye.

It feels like we might be heading to a record breaking season for turnovers (not counting fumbles recovered by our own team). \n\nSecond, our defense is playing really well and I would have loved to see what last season would have looked like with this defense and defensive play calling. It could have been a really good run.\n\nThird, KOC can't work plays when he has nothing to work with. What are people expecting him to do when we have a less than mediocre run option and a QB who is dropping the ball right into the other teams hands, over and over again?\n\nCan you tell me what play you would be calling when your QB can't be trusted and your team can't run the ball effectively. What options do you really have left as an offensive play caller? \n\nFourth, did you actually want to walk away with a win yesterday? We deserved to lose that game. That is one of the worst Vikings games I have seen in my adult life. Even if we would have won, it would feel like a loss. \n\nDobbs was good when other teams weren't expecting him. We were a zero-run QB team and they didn't design their game scheme for a mobile QB.\n\nNow they have and Dobbs advantage is gone.

A gameplan of stretching the field horizontally against the blitz happy Vikings is sound. But there are more ways to do that than just WR screens. Throw a jet sweep in. Touch pass. slants. drags. Anyting else. Especially since you've been doing it all year and the Vikings knew exactly how you were going to attack them. At one point they ran three straight WR screens. Just terrible.\n\nLet's start with the good from Fields. First of all he escaped pressure multiple times that most QBs would have been sacked on (Lucas Patrick sucks). Also, the screen passes were quick and accurate allowing the WRs to make the most out of the YAC opportunity. This is an area he needed to improve from last year and I would say he has shown growth. \n\nPlay 1 in video:\nAnd of course, when the game was on the line, he made a big time throw to get the Bears into FG range. I love the way he stepped up in the pocket and threw with some anticipation. I also love that he targeted his best WR when they needed a play. We know he can do it. Just needs to be more consistent.\n\nPlay 2:\nAs i mentioned above, Fields made some plays that other QBs cannot. He escaped pressure like this a few times and is great out of structure. Also Lucas Patrick Sucks\n\nThat being said, We have to assign some blame to Fields for the offenses struggles. His passing chart is going to be deceiving because they had guys open downfield, Fields just didn't throw it to them. And we can't ignore the fumbles\n\nPlay 3:\nPlay action rollout, half field read. Love it. Makes Fields job easier and plays to his strengths. But he completely misses DJ Moore on the corner route because he rolled too far into pressure. This was the go to read on the play so you gotta make this play\n\nPlay 4:\nThey got deep curls on the outside and an in breaking route from Mooney over the midde. Kmet blocks before leaking out and taking the underneath LB with him leaving Mooney WIDE open over the middle. Vikings show blitz initially before dropping 8 into coverage which clearly Fields wasnt expecting.\n\nPlay 5:\nAnother middle of the field opportunity missed. At one point both Mooney and Scott are open. The endzone view on this one is a really bad look with Scott Wide open. Protection was great on this one\n\nPlay 6:\nThis is a play that shows the good and bad of Fields. The line broke down on this one and Fields did a good job escaping pressure. Few QBs would even be able to keep this play alive so credit to him there. But as he rolled out he had ESB WIDE open for a huge game.

Like\u2026 people might need to be fired.\n\nJustin:\n\nNot a good game. Mostly the second half was the worst until the final drive. Very inconsistent. Made some amazing throws and missed some others. Started turning down routes later in the game. Took at least one unnecessary hit. Kept sinking back at the end of his drop in the second half. He flashed as usual but it\u2019s not good enough rn. JT thinks he can be the guy but doesn\u2019t know if it will ever happen with this situation he\u2019s in. Might have to be with another staff or somewhere else. He likes him but he doesn\u2019t see any anticipation at all. He\u2019s unsure if it\u2019s something with the coaches, Justin, or both. One thing for sure, we can\u2019t have this. Need to be better or else you\u2019re not gonna last in the league.\n\nThe first fumble was bad. He decided to just take off because he wasn\u2019t trusting his protection. Didn\u2019t give the RB a chance and the defender made a play. He missed Mooney that was coming open up top.\n\nSecond fumble was bad, but Kmet also missed the block.\n\nOn a positive note, it did seem like Fields\u2019 footwork was decent and faster for a moment. His release was faster at times too. \n\nGameplan: \n\nBros, it\u2019s bad. The first play was terrible from a personnel choice stand point. Why Kmet? We know he\u2019s decent but he\u2019s not a WR type. \n\nOverall there were way too many screens. On a ton of plays there were either people not getting open, or routes were taking way too long to develop. Questionable and laughable play calling all day. It was pretty ridiculous. Also the whole offensive cast seemed to be getting pissed or not putting in effort on plays. Too many mistakes being made and missed blocks. The attention to detail was just not there. Getsy might actually need to walk the plank after this. \n\nAlso JT is questioning why they aren\u2019t building the offense around the ability of Justin\u2019s Fields running.\n\nOline:\n\nI thought they played fine, but this was a terrible performance. Missed blocks in the running game were killing us. We could only run one type of play effectively. I thought we were good at run blocking but I was wrong. This problem has been apparent all season. And we are one of the highest rushing teams in the league!!!\n\nPass protection was a joke as well. Consistently inconsistent (the theme of Justin too). Lucas Patrick cannot be real. He was blowing blocks all night. Immediate pressure up the middle and ruining plays. Whether it was run or pass plays. We need a center immediately and better coaching or else whoever is QB next year is getting killed.\n\nThe rest of the line was having issues all night too. Free rushers being let in all night. Giving up pressure instantly. I kinda understand why there were a ton of screens now. We can\u2019t pass block effectively consistently. Justin was back to running for his life yet again. He looked like he was seeing ghosts toward of the game. \n\nSo yeah. The offense is a joke right now. The film out there is showing a ton of problems with this cast. JT doesn\u2019t think they\u2019ll run it back with these coaches.

In my opinion blame lies mostly with coaching, but this is a young roster with a lack of experience (which is why we are seeing this team improve on defense so much). \n\nThen in week 4 something changed (for 3 quarters), the offense seemed to click and we put up great numbers. From week 4 till now, week 12, Justin has played some really good football. He misses some reads, sure, but if you look at every snap (which i have and sometimes this offense makes you want to poke your eyes out) he looks like a mostly good QB who needs to clean up some things, which in my opinion are coachable. In my opinion watching the games he has played after the meltdown in kansas, (excluding the vikins, because he got hurt and the offense as a whole was atrocious) he passes the eye test as a qb1. \n\nHe is going through his progressions, checking plays at the line (there is still a good amount of progression to be made here, but he is atleast servicable at this) and he is getting the ball out quicker. He is good at extending plays and when he gets out the pocket he is a pass first qb, which suprised me, because he is such a dynamic runner with the football. He can beat a team with his legs, has one of the best (if not the best) deepballs in the NFL and is starting to get better at the short and intermediate level. \n\nNow for the people who don't care about how somebody looks out on the field and want to look at statistics, here they are.\n\nPassing 4 weeks:\n1003 yards (250.75 ypg)\n86/124 for 69.4% completed passes\nPasser rating of 114.42 (only 5 qb's have a rating over 100 this season)\n9 TD's\n1 INT\n\nRushing 4 weeks:\n245 yards (61 ypg)\n5.5 ypa\n4 fumbles\n3 fumbles lost\n\nSeason (17 games):\n4263 passing yards\n1041 rushing yards\n69.4% complete\n38 Td's\n4 ints\n17 fumbles (13 lost)\n\nSo that would mean Justin would have 5304 total yards with 38 TD's (which could be more if he gets some rushing TD's which he hasn't in these 4 weeks) 4 INT's with 17 fumbles (lost 13). This would be a 9.5 : 1 TD/INT ratio and a 2.2 : 1 TD/TO ratio.\n\nDon't get me wrong Justin still has things he needs to work on (fumbles, reading defenses and throwinflg with anticipation), but if you 1) look at the tape, he is playing confident and going through his progressions more + adjustments and checks at the LOS, which he has improved upon since coming in the league 2) look at the statistics 3) look at the team (we are in a rebuild with guys who need time to develop and gel together). Justin has what it takes to be a top QB in this league, granted he needs to clean up the fumbles and shows more progression reading the defense, which he has done so far.\n\nWould love to hear opinions on this and answer any questions that you might have (and let's please keep it civil)", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9974}, {"ranking": 0.2857142857142857, "comments": "The man is unpredictable I understand what Getsy was trying to do against the blitz, but man, the creativity was lacking.

So, teams on Bears or Panthers schedule losing is good.  \n\n[Current draft order and SOS, via Tankathon](https://www.tankathon.com/nfl)  \n\nTEAMS WITH BYE WEEKS: Bears (4-8), Bills (6-6), Giants (4-8), Raiders (5-7), Ravens (9-3), Vikings (6-6)  \n\n\nTHURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL  \n\nSeahawks (6-5) at Cowboys (8-3)  \nPreferred result = Seahawks win. This game seems pretty irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. But, the Seahawks winning would increase the Cards SOS, helping our pick/Panthers pick win a potential tiebreaker with the Cardinals first rounder in the event that one of us/Panthers end with the same record as the Cards. \n\n\nSUNDAY EARLY SLOT  \n\nChargers (4-7) at Patriots (2-9)  \nPreferred result = Patriots win. Pats are currently the 1.03. Them winning would would increase the Panthers chance of being the 1.01 and put the Patriots only a game behind the Bears.  \n\nLions (8-3) at Saints (5-6)  \nPreferred result = Saints. This game is a bit of a double edged sword. There are a lot of 4-win teams, so our SOS being as low as possible helps with tie breakers.  \n\nFalcons (5-6) at Jets (4-7)  \nPreferred result = Jets win. A Falcons loss lowers the Panthers SOS.  \n\nCardinals (2-10) at Steelers (7-4)  \nPreferred result = Cardinals win. Cards are at the 1.02 now, so a win would be another step towards securing the 1.01. Also puts them just a game behind the Bears in draft order.  \n\nColts (6-5) at Titans (4-7)  \nPreferred result = Titans win. Bears and Tits are both sitting at 4 wins, so a Titans win would move them later than the Bears in draft order.  \n\nDolphins (8-3) at Commanders (4-8)  \nPreferred result = Commanders win. Same reason as above, Commies are at 4 wins so a W would help move them later than the Bears.  \n\nBroncos (6-5) at Houston (6-5)  \nPreferred result = Broncos win. Another game that seems pretty irrelevant since both teams are in playoff contention. The Texans played the Panthers earlier this year, so powering the Panthers\u2019 SOS would be a bit helpful.  \n\n\nSUNDAY AFTERNOON SLOT  \n\nPanthers (1-10) at Buccaneers (4-7)  \nPreferred result = Bucs win. Another step towards us securing the 1.01.  \n\n49ers (8-3) at Eagles (10-1)  \nPreferred result = 49ers win. Another game between playoff teams, so nothing huge at stake here. A 49ers win increases the Cards SOS, helping with any potential tiebreakers.  \n\nBrowns (7-4) at Rams (5-6)  \nPreferred result = Rams win. Same reason as above, increasing Cards SOS seems like the best outcome here.  \n\n\nSUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL  \n\nChiefs (8-3) at GB (5-6)  \nPreferred result = Chiefs win.

Apparently one of the few channels they were able to pick up was one of the big Chicago-based broadcast networks, so of course they managed to get Bears games. That combined with the timing in the 80s meant that the whole town became huge Bears fans.\n\n\nObviously since then access to better coverage has improved significantly, but it's still the case that most everybody in his town supports the Bears because that's who their parents supported.\n\n\nThe second biggest team down there is apparently Washington, because back in the day under their previous name the narrative was that they were representing the natives taking on the gringos, which resonated with folks. Funny how such wildly different perceptions of a single name can exist based on the time / location.\n\n\nAnyways, just thought it was a nice story which y'all might enjoy.

But, I'm a little nervous.\n\nI was listening to a podcast called \" Locked on Texans\", and one their podcast on Monday, they gave a stat. Texans right now have a 46% chance of making the playoffs.\n\nThey can lose one game  against the Titans and Browns and they have a 79% chance of making the playoffs.\n\nTexans can lose to the Broncos and Browns and have a 54% chance of making the playoffs.\n\nIf Texans lose to the Browns,Titans(I believe still one game), and Jets, they have a 28% chance of the playoffs.\n\n\nIf Texans lose to the Colts,Browns, and Jets, they have a 7% chance of the playoffs.\n\nSee the recurring theme here? Texans have to go 4/6 in their remaining games to get into the playoffs WITHOUT help from other teams.\n\nThe remaining schedule is nothing to break out in a cold sweat about, but there are some games that concern me.\n\nBroncos- Denver is on a really hot streak right now. Seems like Dell,Brown, and Collins are all going to be healthy and ready to play. They can also rely on Woods if need be. Broncos also have a really bad run defense, so if we can get Pierce or Singletary going early, this could be an easily winnable game.\n\nJets- I don't know. This just seems like a trap game. Everyone is going to come into this game expecting this as an easy \"W\" for the Texans. Jets are down to their 3rd string QB and so on and so forth. Here's the thing. Texans have dropped \"easily winnable\" games this very season. And this is such a an important game ,too I'm nervous about this one.\n\nBrowns and Titans seem like toss-ups to me as well. Browns D is going to give Stroud and the O-line problems. \n\nWhat do y'all think? Are some of y'all nervous? Or is just being in the playoff picture the 1st year of the rebuild good enough,and everything else from here on just playing with house money? \n\nIt's just Texans offense has gotten off to some really slow starts this season, and they don't yet have the offensive firepower to overcome those slow starts.", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9669}, {"ranking": 0.3382352941176471, "comments": "[Wilson] #Texans tight ends Brevin Jordan and Eric Saubert expected to fill in Sunday for injured veteran Dalton Schultz who is not expected to play against #Broncos due to hamstring injury ", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": -0.7605}, {"ranking": 0.3382352941176471, "comments": "\u201cmidseason pitstop\u201d ", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.3382352941176471, "comments": "In Chicago, Anyone live there or know where I can watch Looked online, didn\u2019t see any texans bar in Chicago.

AG should be scheming better for the talent he has available. BH should have addressed certain aspects of this defense a little more in the offseason.\n\nWith that being said, this team starting out 8-2 before Thanksgiving ruined the perception of how actually talented this roster is. I think the offense is there. The defense is not there. We all expected this defense to at least be average going into this season. They have failed at this. I don\u2019t think it ever had a chance to be given we lost 3 key players in CJGJ, Mosely, and James Houston. \n\nTo put it very simply, we don\u2019t have the fire power on defense yet to cover up the deficiencies we have at every level on the defense. Our DTs suck outside of Alim, Hutch is the only impactful edge, our Lbs don\u2019t have it together yet outside of Anzalone, and our secondary got decimated by injuries/regression by some players. \n\nYet we are 8-3.

No wrong answers here friends!

During the regular season he and some other players came to our grade school. I won the book reading challenge for my grade so I got to have lunch with TD. I asked him he would could just play catch instead of eating because my dad took off on us so I didn\u2019t have anyone to throw the ball to me anymore. He had me run routes and threw to me, taught me how to take handoffs, and even let me tackle him. Then he asked my teacher if I could stay out of class to eat since we skipped lunch. He sat in the cafeteria with me for an hour and listened to all of my favorite plays of his. He gave me his jersey he was wearing and told me to take good care of it. I wore it in school pictures for 3 years in a row. I wore it when we faced the packers in the SB. Terrell Davis is the reason we won that game. And I still wear it when I watch games as an adult in my mid 30s. As an adult and  father I think about that and realize that he didn\u2019t have to do any of that shit, he just did it to make some kids day. TD is a genuinely good human. \n\n\n so much to love about this guy. Sixth round draft pick originally slated to be a 4th or 5th string RB. Destined for practice squad or ST. Ended up earning the starting spot after one preseason. \n\nWent on to have one of the greatest single seasons in RB history. Super bowl MVP. NFL MVP. NFL OPOTY. Absolutely annihilated opponents in the post-season. Earned a place in the HOF despite only having a 7 year career.

In the event that we suck with Hackett as coach and Lock as starter, we could look to draft a QB in the 2023 draft class with guys like Bryce Young, Will Levis and CJ Stroud expected to be high first round picks.\n3. **Draft a QB**. With the 9th pick in the draft we are probably well set to land one of the top QBs in the 2022 draft, like Matt Corrall, Kenny Pickett, Desmond Ridder, Malik Willis or Sam Howell. According to most projections only one QB is likely to be off the board by the time we pick, and if necessary we could trade up to get our guy.\n4. **Sign a veteran**. Matt Ryan has been released by the Falcons. Marcus Mariota, Tyrod Taylor and Jacoby Brissett are available. Jameis Winston still hasn't resigned with the Saints.

VJ played to our strengths, ensuring the game was played on *our terms.* Giving guys like Surtain, JMac, Simmons, and Locke the chance to make plays instead of straining our run D was monumental in this win. Sure, there were drops by Njoku+Ford, but I'm sure VJ accounted for all that when designing our Defensive plan for Sunday. The hard hitting was especially great. We were physical from minute 1 minute 60. That type of mentality WINS in the playoffs when games are tighter. That toughness leads to turnovers, and 3 more from the boys on Sunday went a long way to ANOTHER W. \n\nThe offense was a revelation. Run game was efficient, we got huge chunk plays from Court and the RB's, and Russ was basically immaculate. Apart from the fumble, Russ had a great game. Extending plays, being prudent with the ball, making calls at the line into favourable runs, Running it himself, he was great. The O-line played incredible too. Neutralizing Garrett, making holes for Pookie and Samajae, and giving Russ time: This was their best performance of the year. \n\nThe special teams didn't have any flash plays to me, but the kicking remained solid which is a great sign. \n\nThis Sunday at Houston is the biggest game of the season, and if we can build on this performance against a top tier AFC team, we'll be in great shape.

Eric TheEnemy and Jack lost Defense The 100% legit Chat GPI plan for us against the Dolphins:\n\n: Game Plan for the Washington Commanders (Offense and Defense):\n\nOffense:\n1. Establish the Running Game: The Miami Dolphins have a solid pass defense, so it's crucial to establish a strong running game early on. Utilize a mix of power runs and misdirection plays to keep the defense guessing.\n\n2. Target the Weak Secondary: The Dolphins' secondary has shown some vulnerabilities this season. Exploit their weaknesses by targeting their cornerbacks with quick slant routes, deep post routes, and double moves. Look for favorable matchups and exploit them.\n\n3. Utilize Play-Action Passes: With a strong running game established, use play-action passes to keep the defense off balance. This will create opportunities for deep throws downfield and open up passing lanes for intermediate routes.\n\n4. Protect the Quarterback: The Dolphins have a talented pass rush, so it's crucial to provide solid protection for the quarterback. Use max protection schemes, quick passes, and rollouts to minimize the pressure on the quarterback. \n\nDefense:\n1. Stop the Run: The Miami Dolphins have a capable running back, so it's important to focus on shutting down their running game. Stack the box, maintain gap integrity, and pursue tackles aggressively to limit their ground attack.\n\n2. Pressure the Quarterback: The Dolphins' offensive line has struggled with pass protection, so it's essential to apply consistent pressure on the quarterback. Utilize a mix of blitzes, stunts, and disguised coverages to disrupt their passing game and force quick, inaccurate throws.\n\n3. Contain the Wide Receivers: The Dolphins have some talented wide receivers who can make big plays. Play tight, physical coverage on the outside, and use double teams when necessary to limit their impact on the game. \n\n4. Force Turnovers: In order to gain an advantage, focus on creating turnovers. Strip the ball, jump passing routes, and be opportunistic when the quarterback makes mistakes. Turnovers can swing the momentum of the game in our favor.\n\nOverall, the key to success against the Miami Dolphins is a balanced offensive attack, solid protection for the quarterback, and a disciplined and aggressive defensive approach. By executing this game plan effectively, the Washington Commanders can increase their chances of coming out with a victory on December 3, 2023.\n\n\nSound familiar to anyone?", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9665}, {"ranking": 0.4142857142857143, "comments": "// 2024 WASHINGTON FREE AGENTS // Smith-Williams and Toohill also part of list but couldn't fit on image. \n\nWho's your priority resignings?

His departure will include major lieutenants of Rivera's regime such as Marty Hurney, Martin Mayhew, etc. It's likely Ron Rivera is allowed to give a final press conference, as a sign of class and respect from ownership, with another press conference led by ownership later in the same week. New ownership will formally start their search for a General Manager with a hiring announced by the end of January 2024.\n\nBased upon an insider [scoop](https://x.com/BurgundyBlog/status/1728923626953703810?s=20) from Burgundy Blog, it's very possible that the new General Manager will be Ian Cunningham.\n\nAn interesting connection to the current Washington front office is that he spent several years in Baltimore which overlapped with Eugene Shen, the recently hired SVP of Football Strategy. His father was a NBA agent while his second cousin (Arthur Ashe) was the reason for the Citi Open tennis tournament came to DC prior to Mark Ein (limited owner) acquiring it. Overall, there are good connections to portions of ownership outside of his impressive front office resume which includes two Super Bowls and numerous team playoff appearances:\n\n* Assistant General Manager with Chicago Bears (2022 - Present)\n* Director of Player Personnel with Philadelphia Eagles (2021)\n* Assistant Director of Player Personnel with Philadelphia Eagles (2019 - 2020)\n* Director of College Scouting with Philadelphia Eagles (2017 - 2018)\n* Area Scout with Baltimore Ravens (2013 - 2016)\n* Personnel Assistant with Baltimore Ravens (2008 - 2012)\n\nLast offseason, Cunningham was offered the Arizona Cardinals GM position but declined. He also interviewed for last year's GM vacancy with the Tennessee Titans. Since joining Ryan Poles in Chicago, he's been his understudy although most NFL insiders consider him a disciple of Hall of Game GM Ozzie Newsome.\n\nI'd assume an area of importance with a new Head Coach would be their ability to develop Sam Howell or any future QB drafted in 2025 should Howell not work out. The favorite would be current Detroit OC Ben Johnson who should be comfortable with Josh Harris' style of blending analytics into football operations, in part because Ben Johnson himself graduated from UNC with a degree in mathematics and computer science.\n\nI think it's very possible we see him as the new Commanders Head Coach shortly after the Detroit Lions season concludes. Competition for Ben Johnson will likely be the following teams:\n\n* Carolina Panthers\n* Chicago Bears\n* Los Angeles Chargers\n* New England Patriots\n* Las Vegas Raiders\n\nHowever, we can weed down some of these teams with deductive reasoning via each team's recent history and Ben Johnson's behavior last season when he passed on leaving Detroit.\n\n**Carolina Panthers:**\n\nBen Johnson was targeted as a candidate for the Carolina Panthers last offseason. However, he declined and opted to stay with Detroit. While he has connections to the Carolina region such as attending UNC and growing up in North Carolina, the Panthers franchise didn't exist until he was 7 years old. Prior to 1993, much of the Carolinas belonged to the Washington Redskins meaning there's a good chance Ben Johnson comes from a family of Washington fans. For context purposes, Washington won 4 Super Bowls between Jan. 1983 - Jan 1992 with Johnson born in 1986 - the middle of Washington's dominance. If Ben Johnson didn't want to even interview with Carolina last offseason - when they were more attractive as an option - it doesn't make sense he'd entertain them again this offseason.\n\n**Chicago Bears:**\n\nWith Chicago, it's possible that they retain Matt Eberflus while Ryan Poles is still the General Manager. Eberflus has the excuse that his hiring was in part to conduct a rebuild so the poor records are as expected. The defense has performed better as the 2023 season progresses and an argument can be made that Justin Fields is holding the team back. This could result in Poles and Eberflus selecting their own QB in 2024 while trading Justin Fields - who would be entering the deadline for his 5th year option. If the defense finishes strong, Chicago OC Luke Getsy could also be fired as a scapegoat.\n\nHowever, according to NFL Insider Albert Breer, it's becoming increasingly likely that new Team President Kevin Warren cleans house and fires both Ryan Poles and Matt Eberflus -- instead hiring his own people for football operations. It's possible the replacement for Eberflus would be Michigan Head Coach Jim Harbaugh, who has ties to the Chicago franchise and Team President Kevin Warren. Harbaugh has been speculated to have interest should the position be available. This would remove Chicago as an opportunity for Ben Johnson either due to Eberflus surviving or Harbaugh being hired.\n\n**LA Chargers:**\n\nBrandon Staley has been on the hot seat since their disappointing collapse last postseason in the Wild Card round against Jacksonville, which was the largest blown lead in Chargers history. In early November 2023, it was [reported](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10096256-latest-nfl-hot-seat-updates-after-first-coach-firing-of-season-and-week-9-games) that the Chargers will likely retain Brandon Staley for next season but on a short leash. Chargers ownership is notoriously cheap with reluctance to terminate coaching contracts too early to avoid a large buy-out.\n\nA Chargers Head Coach has been allowed at least four years before firing since 2001. Brandon Staley's record isn't drastically different than either of the last two coaches, Anthony Lynn and Mike McCoy, both which were given four seasons before contract termination. Due to this, it's unlikely the Chargers will even have a vacancy for Ben Johnson to interview for.\n\n**New England Patriots &amp; Las Vegas Raiders:**\n\nThe situation in New England is difficult to gauge but it seems as if Robert Kraft would prefer to promote from within. Kraft's candidate of choice appears to be ILB Coach Jerod Mayo who has rejected offers from other teams to stay in New England previously. Kraft even [said](https://clutchpoints.com/patriots-news-former-patriots-star-the-favorite-to-replace-bill-belichick-as-head-coach-if-he-doesnt-return-next-season) the following about Mayo at the March NFL Owners' meeting, \u201cThere\u2019s no ceiling on his ability to be a head coach, and he\u2019ll be a head coach. I\u2019m sure of that. I hope he\u2019s with us. So we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Mayo has also been a regular favorite of betting sites when it comes to New England's next Head Coach.\n\nLas Vegas is currently testing out Antonio Pierce but that seems unlikely as their last interim Head Coach went 7-5 but still didn't get the job. Mark Davis also appears to have a fascination with the New England Patriots which makes me wonder if he'd want another coach from that tree such as Brian Flores or Bill O'Brien. Regardless, Vegas will be a tough destination as they will likely be hiring a new GM and HC with the potential need to trade-up to draft a rookie QB in Round 1. That's a high risk situation when also paired with the Raiders' free agent and salary cap situation.\n\n**So** **Why Washington?**\n\nIt's very likely Washington decides to keep Sam Howell as the starter for 2024. Players and coaches around the league have given him a lot of respect although he's been negatively impacted by several factors out of his control:\n\n* Arguably the worst defense in the entire NFL\n* Bottom tier offensive line that will need another overhaul\n* \\#2 most impactful [EPA](https://www.carolinahuddle.com/topic/219949-qb-epa-lost-due-to-wr-drops/) from dropped passes by receivers\n\nHowever, he's not without blame as he's had two implosion games against Buffalo and New York that appear to be outliers in his 13 career starts. However, if you remove the Buffalo and second Giants game his stats measure very favorably compared to other starting QBs through NFL Week 11:\n\n* 65.6% completion rate -- #15 in NFL\n* 2,913 yards passing -- #5 in NFL\n* 17 passing TDs -- #11 in NFL\n* 6 INTs -- #9 in NFL (tied with others)\n* 2 rushing TDs -- #7 in NFL\n* QB Rate: 94.57 -- #12 in NFL\n* 291.3 yards/game -- #3 in NFL\n\nHe has more career TDs and has shown more talent than Kenny Pickett, who has a 13-9 career record due to Pittsburgh's strong defense. In 2022, Washington's defense allowed 20.2 points/game instead of the 29.2 points/game allowed in 2023. If that carried over to this season, rounding up to 21 points allowed per game, Washington would have been 7-5 with the #6 seed in the NFC leading into Thanksgiving.\n\nBen Johnson also has familiarity with Sam Howell from the 2022 Senior Bowl. Howell [said](https://theathletic.com/3110739/2022/02/04/lions-ben-johnson-gets-high-marks-in-his-trial-run-as-offensive-coordinator-hes-a-great-teacher/) \"He\u2019s a great teacher. He just knows how to relate to people. He knows how to best get a message across, (he) teaches in a way that everyone can understand.\u201d Ben Johnson, as a former walk-on QB and graduate of UNC, admitted to watching Sam Howell during his college years. In this video [posted](https://youtu.be/yDxM9paPZjk) by the Detroit Lions, Ben Johnson and Mark Brunell (Lions QB Coach) appear impressed with Howell's throwing ability. Their time together at the Senior Bowl was likely positive, as Sam Howell was the only QB for the American Team to score a TD and show consistent productivity while Ben Johnson called plays.\n\n**2024 Draft Order Prediction:**\n\nBased upon the upcoming schedules for the Commanders and the rest of the league, via [NFL Playoff Predictor](https://next.playoffpredictors.com/), I think the Top 10 draft selections look like:\n\n1. Chicago via Carolina\n2. Chicago\n3. New England\n4. Arizona\n5. Tennessee\n6. NY Giants\n7. Washington\n8. NY Jets\n9. Atlanta\n10. Las Vegas\n\nIn this scenario, Washington secures a valuable draft pick to compliment the \\~$87M in cap space they're expected have for the 2024 offseason. This cap space can easily be expanded to over $100M by releasing the following players:\n\n* Logan Thomas, TE - saves $6.5M\n* Andrew Wylie, OL - saves $1.5M\n* Charles Leno Jr, OL - saves $7.5M\n* Trenton Scott, OL - saves $1.3M\n\nI'd consider restructuring the deal of Charles Leno Jr. if he'd be willing to mentor a potential LT pick in RD1. Leno has been a solid LT throughout his career and the ability to pass that knowledge and wisdom to a rookie such as Olu Fashanu or Joe Alt is invaluable. \n\nHowever, there are concerns as Chicago, New York (Giants), New England, and Tennessee are all teams with obvious needs at QB. Teams such as Arizona could keep Kyler Murray for another year as his dead cap substantially decreases in 2025 - making them a candidate for trading down unless they draft Marvin Harrison Jr. Teams such as Las Vegas and Atlanta could trade-up for Chicago's #1 or #2 overall pick as it's unlikely Chicago trades out of the Top 10.\n\nOverall, it's very likely we see a 3-4 Quarterbacks drafted before Washington would select at #7 overall. This would position Washington for their ideal choice of non-QB players such as Olu Fashanu or Joe Alt, both considered blue-chip Offensive Tackles.", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9986}, {"ranking": 0.4142857142857143, "comments": "Knowing what we know now.

My boy Godwin is slumping a bit because he needs more quick touches to get up to speed on games and to get hit on crosses.

He has to be the most underachieving coach in the entire league. Look at the talent last year and this year, and he is 12-16 thus far. It's not acceptable. And then he goes up in the presser talking about \"we're only a game behind the division lead\" which is true but feels like he thinks our performance is acceptable as long as the division is within reach. AND his idiotic use of time outs. Once again we go into the half with all three and then on our attempted comeback drive, why do we RUSH to run a second play before the 2 min warning and not use a timeout. We gained a few yards, neglected to use a timeout before the 2 min warning, rushed a play, and got flagged for an illegal formation iirc. Use the damn timeout, take your time for a play, and still have the 2 min warning. I swear Bowles has NO IDEA how to use timeouts.\n\nOffense: Bad day overall. Sure Rachaad had 100 yards and 6.7 ypc but he had one really long run inflate it. Would you rather have his 15 rushes for 100 and 6.7 ypc or Taylor's 15 rushes for 91 yards and 6.1 ypc? To me Taylor impacted his team more and moved the chains when needed. Don't get me started on Canales' continued decision to NOT give Godwin chances. Evans and Godwin combined for 9 touches while Rachaad had 15 carries and 2 receptions. Canales keeps saying teams are focusing on Godwin and Evans. Yeah? Is this the FIRST time teams have focused on them? Other teams figure out ways to get their top guys open yet we don't. We still can't score consistently in the red zone. It's been 11 games and we still have the same issues. At least Evans is at 850 yards and 9 TD (2nd in league). He got his 90th all time TD too and is moving up the all time charts!\n\nDefense: Lavonte was out so I knew the run defense would struggle. And it did. Carlton Davis has regressed. He is consistently getting beat by average guys now. Pittman had over 100 yards on him. The pass rush struggled and really should've excelled. For a team with a defensive mastermind at the helm, this defense is playing below their level and will be enough to get Toilet Bowles fired since he can't even do that right. It's not like we don't have the talent.\n\nAnyways, how many people are REALLY confident that we can beat the Panthers? Like honestly, I know they're terrible but do we feel it's a lock? Seems like the type of game where they get their offense on track against us, especially considering we suck at home for some reason. This is not good. Anyways, my full reaction is here: [https://youtu.be/\\_1NdDajaDyM](https://youtu.be/_1NdDajaDyM)", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": -0.9047}, {"ranking": 0.5294117647058824, "comments": "Mike Evans Hall of Fame case Now obviously Evans career isn\u2019t over, but more and more we\u2019re seeing the argument, is he a hall of famer?\n\nIt seems like the general public is now more on the side of yes, but here are some points that i think make his case overwhelming as long as he plays at least another 2 seasons.\n\nCurrently Evans is 15th all time in receiving touchdowns with 90. Not a single eligible player ahead of him on the list didn\u2019t make the Hall.\n\nOf the hall of famers ahead of Evans on the TD list, not a single one retired before their age 35 season. If you were to assume Evans doesn\u2019t play another game this season, and plays at the pace of his worst statistical year (2017: 1001 yards, 5 touchdowns), evans would be at 16,000 receiving yards (third all time) and 115 touchdowns (8th all time) through his age 35 season. This is using his WORST season as pace and eliminating the rest of this season. I think the big milestone for evans would be at 15,000 yards, which he would only need 745 yards a season through his age 35 year to achieve. I think he also likely beats the 115 mark and at least passes Gates for 7th all time. \n\nThese were conservative projections based off worst season that i feel only injury( which as he ages is obv more of a risk) could prevent. 15,000 yards and 115TD obviously gets him in the hall.\n\n\nHowever, the most common argument against evans is that he was never really a top 5 receiver in any given season and  his stats are mostly volume. For one, this is stupid because Evans has over 40 games fewer played than anyone around him on the TDs leaderboard besides Adams and Gronk. But here\u2019s the bigger argument against these \u201cpeak claims\u201d\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single 5 year span in Evans career where he wasn\u2019t top 5 in receding touchdowns and not a single 6 season span where he wasn\u2019t top 5 in receiving yards.\n\nThe only 3 years spans he wasn\u2019t top 5 in touchdowns were 2015-2017 (11th) and 2017-2019 (also 11th). However in both of  those three year stretches he was top 5 in receiving yards. From 2014-2016, 2016-2018, 2018-2020, 2019-2021, and 2020-2023, Evans was top 5 in touchdowns scored as a receiver. So regardless of how long you define a peak, evans was always a top 5 receiver in terms of TD.\n\nTo summarize, there isn\u2019t a single 3 year stretch where evans isn\u2019t either top 5 in touchdowns or yards, and besides 2017-2021 where he finished 7th in yards (just 200 yards behind fifth) there isn\u2019t a single 5 year stretch where he isn\u2019t top 5 in both touchdowns and receiving yards.\n\nThis man is CLEARLY a hall of famer.", "date": "20231127", "sentiment": -0.981}, {"ranking": 0.5294117647058824, "comments": "Interesting post-game remarks by Baker after the Colts loss It definitely seems like there\u2019s something brewing in the locker room.

It was good to see some bucs representation in NorCal. There were more bucs fans than I was expecting. \n\n2. The momentum shift was huge on the baker fumble. The long drive really seemed to suck the life out of the stadium, and then as soon as that fumble happened the energy came back 10 fold. That may have been the game right there in my opinion. Would have been completely different if we scored on that drive.\n\n3. It seemed like there was a lot more creativity from Canales. Barely saw any runs up the middle on first. Lots of movement at the line/ hand offs outside the tackles/quick passes to the flat. Was more impressed with him than I had been in previous weeks. Hopefully this trend sticks even though we didn\u2019t get the win. \n\n4. There were a few DPI\u2019s/holds on Evan\u2019s that didn\u2019t get called. Not sure if it was easily seen on the broadcast. \n\n5. I  was screaming on that long drive in the 4th on those final 2 downs. Once we got to 3rd and 4th in the red zone, baker threw it into triple coverage to Mike, and then threw it again to the end zone on 4th. With only two plays needed to get 4 yards on a crucial drive of the game, I\u2019d think that we\u2019d try to at least get a quick throw across the chains on one of the downs. Also, would have made sense to roll baker out on one of the plays with the option to tuck it and run. After such a long drive, and the chance to turn it into a one score game, we absolutely blew it there and it seemed pretty obvious to not throw to the end zone on both plays ", "date": "20231120", "sentiment": 0.9811}, {"ranking": 0.5294117647058824, "comments": "Book by former Buc Steve White, a former Buc, wrote a book called Passing on the Game.

Zeno states that to get from point A to point B an object must travel half way there, and to get half way, you must first reach a quarter of the distance and so on. The concept being that there is an infinite number of points between a destination and the starting point such that an object cannot traverse an infinite number of points in a finite time. \n\nIn football terms a player can simply cross the goal line if they have possession of the ball in open play. Like clockwork the eagles get to the one or two yard line and tush push their way to six. Once the ball is snapped the paradox has no value, but before the snap the ball placement is subject to the ref\u2019s placement and within the 5 yard line the best the ref can do is half the distance to the goal.  Therefore no matter how many times there is a penalty, the ref cannot place the ball in the end zone. The football can only ever approach the end zone this way. \n\nThe idea then is to blow up the play by jumping offside and tackling Hurts before they have a chance to snap. How many times? However many you want! You can do it forever. Grind the game to a halt, an endless time loop of unwatchable garbage. You hope that they either false start and push themselves back or get bored and change the play, but you don\u2019t let them do what they want to do. You filibuster the entire football game until you get the outcome you\u2019re looking for.

Of course the plays they were injured on were clean football plays and it was just pure bad luck (and some poor scheme design trying to block an 18.5 sack player with a backup TE).  But the time has come for Deeboo Samuel\u2019s Super Bowl in week 13. And the teams entering the game as the top 2 teams in the conference followed closely by the Dallas Cowboys who the Eagles will face off against this week. While people will want to compare this game to last year's NFC Championship quite a few things have changed, like former Eagle Javon Hargave will still be playing, but in the opposing uniform and the Eagles have a number of changes on their defense, offense and two different coordinators. Additionally the 49ers also have some new faces on the lines in addition to Hargrave, the 49ers also added former Commander Chase Young and in their secondary is a little different on the backend. Still with the new faces, these are both two of the the top teams in the NFC again and could easily face off up again in the playoffs. The key for the Eagles will be slowing down the 49ers rushing attack, in the games where the 49ers struggled the most were the ones where the opposing team slowed down the rushing attack and limited the playaction and RPO game and forced Purdy to beat them with his arm. On offense the Eagles OL will need to play a dominant game and control the line of scrimmage to get the run game going and give Hurts time to throw the football. Smith and Brown were limited in that game, but that was more so due to the fact the Eagles went up 3 TDs and ran the ball 44 times and were very conservative after getting the lead. They should have a bigger impact in this game as long as Hurts has time to throw the football. If the Eagles can win in the trenches and get the lead early, they should be able to add number 11 to the win column.

The Eagles scored on the opening drive after the refs missed the ball coming loose on a Devonta Smith catch and the Eagles hurried to the line and ran a play as Shanahan kept the challenge flag in his pocket. The Eagles ran the ball in two plays later to Miles Sanders to take a 7-0 lead. On the following possession, the 49ers learned why the Eagles led the league in sacks when they tried to block Hassan Reddick with a TE leading to a sack fumble which took QB Brock Purdy out of the game with a UCL injury. From there the 49ers could do little on offense, though the 49ers did tie it up with a Christian McCaffrey TD run, however the Eagles took the lead right back on the next possession to give them a 14-7 lead. The Eagles extended the lead further after a fumbled snap by the 49ers and the Eagles made it 21-7 going into half time. On the first possession after the half it went from bad to worse for the 49ers as they lost their second QB Josh Johnson to a concussion. With the 49ers already losing the battle in the trenches on both sides of the football and now down 14 points and no way to pass the Eagles ran out the clock with long time consuming drives on 2 out of their next 3 possessions which ate up 13+ minutes of clock and added another 11 points for the Eagles as they finished off the 49ers 31-7.| \nClick here to view the [Video Recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=haJM-KD849k)|\nClick here to view the [Stats Recap](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202301290phi.htm)|\n \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Last 10 Meetings**\n \n|**Date**|**Winner**|**Loser**|**Score**|\n--:|:--|:--|:--|\n|01/29/2023|Eagles|49ers|31-7|\n|09/19/2021|49ers|Eagles|17-11|\n|10/4/2020|Eagles|49ers|25-20|\n|10/29/2017|Eagles|49ers|33-10|\n|9/28/2014|49ers|Eagles|26-21|\n|10/2/2011|49ers|Eagles|24-23|\n|10/10/2010|Eagles|49ers|27-24|\n|12/20/2009|Eagles|49ers|27-13|\n|10/12/2008|Eagles|49ers|40-26|\n|9/24/2006|Eagles|49ers|38--24|\n|9/18/2005|Eagles|49ers|42-3|\n|12/21/2003|49ers|Eagles|31-28|\n\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Injury Reports**|**Depth Charts**|\n:-:|:-:\n[Eagles](http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/team/injury-report.html)|[Eagles](http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/team/depth-chart.html)|\n[49ers](https://www.49ers.com/team/injury-report/)|[49ers](https://www.49ers.com/team/depth-chart)|\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n2023 \u201cExpert\u201d Picks|\n:-:|\n[Week 4 - \"Expert\" Picks](http://nflpickwatch.com/?week=4)|\n \n**2023 Team Stats**|\n:-:|\n[Eagles Season Stats](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/phi/2023.htm)|\n[49ers Season Stats](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/2023.htm)|\n \n&amp;nbsp;

The Eagles were again not great in the first half and for the second time in two weeks trailed 17-7 going into halftime and again Hurts rallied the team. The Eagles trailed by 3 when James Bradberry picked off Josh Allen in the fourth quarter setting up Hurts' 29-yard TD pass to Zaccheaus for a 28-24 Philly lead. The Bills responded with a 10-play drive spanning over five minutes. The Bills ran the ball effectively, putting them in position to retake the lead. Allen executed a perfect play-action pass to Gabriel Davis from seven yards out to give Buffalo the lead 31-28. But the Eagles wouldn\u2019t go away. Philadelphia drove into Bills territory before the Bills tightened up as AJ Epenesa disrupted a Hurts pass and safety Jordan Poyer broke up a pass to force a long field goal. A long field goal which would  be nothing for Eagles kicker Jake Elliott who hammered a 59-yard field goal in the pouring rain to tie the game and forcing OT.  Bills got the ball first driving down the field, but were held to a 40 yard Bass football which put the ball in Hurts hands. The Eagles drove down the field before Hurts scampered  into the end zone from 12 yards out on a QB draw with 2:37 left in overtime, and the Eagles beat the Buffalo Bills 37-34. |\n**49ers**|\nThe 49ers took on division rival Seattle Seahawks on Thanksgiving night. The 49ers took a 24-3 lead before halftime and never looked back en route to a 31-13 win. Deebo Samuel opened the scoring with his third rushing touchdown of the season to set the tone. The Seahawks were able to respond on a Jason Myers 51-yard field goal but were then silenced until a Jordyn Brooks pick-six in the third quarter, his first career interception. Another Myers field goal brought the Seahawks within 11 points by the end of the third, but a Purdy touchdown pass to Brandon Aiyuk sealed the victory for San Francisco. San Francisco dominated almost every aspect of the game, including time of possession. The Niners owned the rock for 35.5 minutes as opposed to Seattle\u2019s 24.5.|\n\n  \nGeneral|\n:---|\n**Referee**: Alex Kemp|\nPhiladelphia has won the most games in the NFL this season, tallying a league-best 10-1 mark. The Eagles have either held or shared the top record in the NFL every week dating back to Week 1 of 2022.|\nThis is the sixth time in franchise history that Philadelphia has started 10-1 through 11 contests, having previously done so during the 1949, 1980, 2004, 2017 and 2022 campaigns. The Eagles have totaled 10+ wins in back-to-back years for the first time since 2013-14.|\nAccording to Elias Sports, Philadelphia is the fourth NFL team to ever start 10-1 or better in consecutive seasons, along with the 2005-06 Colts, 1972-73 Dolphins and 1941-42 Bears. Nick Sirianni is the third head coach to start 10-1 or better in two straight years, joining Tony Dungy (2005-06 Colts) and Don Shula (1972-73 Dolphins).|\nJalen Hurts became only the second NFL QB since 1950 to start 10-1 or better through 11 games in back-to-back seasons, joining Peyton Manning (2005-06 Colts) in that category (Elias Sports).|\nIncluding playoffs, Nick Sirianni and Jalen Hurts have combined for a 34-11 (.756) record. That is the 5th-most wins by a HC-QB duo during their first 45 games together since the 1970 merger, trailing only Andy Reid-Patrick Mahomes (36-9), Matt LaFleur-Aaron Rodgers (36-9), John Fox-Peyton Manning (35-10) and Don Shula-Dan Marino (35-10).|\nNick Sirianni owns a 33-12 career record with the Eagles, marking the highest regular season winning percentage (.733) by a head coach in franchise history. It is also the 2nd-best figure by an NFL head coach since 2021, behind Andy Reid (.756, 34-11). Philadelphia has registered a 24-4 mark since the start of last season, which amounts to a league-leading .857 winning percentage during that stretch.|\nThe Eagles have produced a 27-2 (.931) record in the last 29 regular-season games started by Jalen Hurts (dating back to Week 15 of 2021), including 16-1 since Week 11 of 2022. Since 2021, Hurts has posted a .781 winning percentage (32-9), which leads all NFL QBs.|\nAccording to Elias Sports, Jalen Hurts is the third NFL QB since 1950 to win 27+ games over the span of 29 starts during the regular season, joining Tom Brady (2003-05) and Jim McMahon (1983-88).|\nJalen Hurts has won 14 straight games against teams with winning records, marking the longest streak by an NFL QB since 1950. He is also tied for the most game-winning drives (4) in the league this year.|\nPhiladelphia has won 8 consecutive home games (including playoffs), marking the 2nd-longest active home winning streak in the NFL, trailing only Dallas (13). It is also tied for the 5th-best home winning streak in team history (longest since a 9-game streak from 2016-17).|\nIncluding playoffs, the Eagles are 17-3 (.850) in their last 20 games at Lincoln Financial Field. Over the last two seasons (since 2022), Philadelphia is tied with San Francisco for the 2nd-highest home winning percentage (.875, 14-2) in the NFL, behind Dallas (.929, 13-1).|\nSince 2017, the Eagles have won 3 of their last 4 games against the 49ers (including playoffs). In the last meeting between the two franchises, Philadelphia defeated San Francisco, 31-7, in the 2022 NFC Championship Game on 1/29/23 at Lincoln Financial Field.|\nThe Eagles are averaging 28.2 points per game, which is tied with San Francisco for the 3rd-most in the NFL, behind Dallas (31.6) and Miami (30.8). Philadelphia has recorded 28+ points in all 5 home games this year, tying for the longest streak in Eagles single-season history.|\nOn third and fourth down combined, Philadelphia leads the NFL with a 50.3% conversion percentage. The Eagles rank 3rd in third-down offense (47.3%), behind Buffalo (49.7%) and Dallas (47.7%), while also pacing the league with a 76.5% success rate on fourth down.|\nPhiladelphia ranks 5th in the NFL in red zone TD efficiency (62.8%), trailing only Miami (73.0%), Buffalo (67.4%), Baltimore (64.6%) and L.A. Chargers (63.9%). Since Week 5, the Eagles lead the NFL in red zone offense (70.0%), converting on 21 of 30 red zone drives.|\nPhiladelphia ranks 2nd in the league in pressures (189, tied with San Francisco), behind Baltimore (206). The Eagles also have the 5th-most QB hits (78) in the NFL, trailing only Baltimore (84), San Francisco (84), Miami (82) and Buffalo (80), and are tied for 11th in sacks (32).|\nPhiladelphia owns the 3rd-best rushing defense (85.3 ypg) in the NFL, trailing only Chicago (79.5 ypg) and San Francisco (82.0 ypg). The Eagles are one of only four teams that have allowed 5-or-fewer rushing TDs this year, joining Atlanta (4), Baltimore (4) and San Francisco (5).|\nJalen Hurts ranks 2nd in the NFL with 29 total TDs, trailing only Josh Allen (33). In Week 12 vs. Buffalo, Hurts combined for a career-high 5 total TDs (3 passing, 2 rushing) in the come-from-behind victory.

Williams anchors the left side of the line, but the rest of the 49ers offensive line is a bit shotty. The biggest worry has be trying to stop Hasaan Reddick whose hit on Purdy in the NFCCG knocked the QB cause a bit of controversy and sparked much of the offseason jabber from the 49ers. You have to think Reddick lines up against first year starter Colton McKivitz who was a 5th round pick in 2020, but this is his first year starting. McKivitz has struggled against speed rushers this season. TJ Watt had three sacks against McKivitz and he also struggled against other speed edge rushers as well. Sweat and Reddick both utilize their speed to get around the edge which should spell trouble for McKivitz who does not have talent to keep up with either. The 49ers would be wise to give McKivitz some help or at least not try to block either of the Eagles edge rushers 1 on 1 with a TE. If they do give help it could open things up for the Eagles interior pass rush to feast on the 49ers interior OL.|\n**Christian McCaffery vs the Eagles Run Defense.**|\nThe 49ers want to run the football, it helps set up the rest of their offense and they run the ball second most in the league behind the Baltimore Ravens. It makes sense when the best player on their offense is their running back and McCaffrey is having a great year so far with a combined 16 TDs, 11 on the ground. The 49ers will be running into the strength of the Eagles defense though, they have allowed just 683 yards on the ground and just 2 rushing TDs and are only giving up 3.7 yards per carry this season. McCaffrey will be a challenge though with his athleticism and the fact the Eagles have multiple injuries at the LB position which could spell trouble. If the Eagles are able to shut down the running game and force the 49ers into third and long where their pass rushers can get to Purdy it would be big for the Eagles in winning the football game.|\n**49ers DL vs the Eagles OL**|\nThis is a strength on strength matchup, but one I think the Eagles should win especially if Lane Johnson is back after popping some scar tissue in his groin which caused him to miss last week's game. If the groin isn\u2019t affecting him I think the Eagles could win this matchup, without him though it may get a iffy. Last time these two units faced off the Eagles completely dominated the matchup pancaking the 49ers defenders on multiple plays. [Here is one of Mailata on Bosa](https://twitter.com/BaldyNFL/status/1620033859009269760). The 49ers have added some additional pieces in former Eagles Javon Hargrave who has had a nice season thus far for the 49ers and former Commander Chase Young who did have a sack against Mailata in week 4, though Mailata dominated him in week 8. The Eagles OL will need to be on their game this week and dominate the line of scrimmage to keep the high powered 49ers offense on the sideline.|\n**AJ Brown and Devonta Smith vs Charvarius Ward and Deommodore Lenoir**|\nThis is a matchup I thought the Eagles could have exploited last time these two teams faced off. Last year they gave up multiple big games to WRs prior to the matchup and this year is no different. In their biggest loss this season Ja\u2019Marr Chase had 10 receptions for 100 yards and a TD and Tee Higgins had an additional 5 receptions for 69 yards. The 49ers also gave up big games to Amari Cooper (4 rec, 108 yards), Puka Nacua (15 rec, 147 yards), Jordan Addison 7 rec, 123 yards, 2 TDs), Christian Kirk (6 rec, 104 yards). That's a pretty lot of big games against opposing WRs and the Eagles do have two very talented WRs in Brown and Smith who combined for 1788 and 12 TDs this season. Brown is due for a game and has a size advantage over both 49ers cornerbacks Brown has 26 lbs and 3 inches on Lenior and has 30lbs on Ward. . Smith may be the scarier option for the 49ers though, who have struggled against speed on the outside and have given up a number of big deep catches this year. If the Eagles are able to protect Hurts and start attacking the outside and forcing the 49ers to focus on stopping it, it will open up the middle of the field for the TEs and Julio Jones and allow the run game to get going which will open up the entire playbook for the Eagles. It should be noted the San Francisco media is keying on the fact Smith had 2 catches for 36 yards, while Brown had 4 catches for 28 yards in last year's NFCG. While this is true the Eagles also went up 3 TDs early and the 49ers had no QBs, so the Eagles ran the ball 44 times in that contest and were very conserved after getting the big lead.|\n\n \n\n**Note this looks best  in www.old.reddit.com, new reddit messed up my formatting which trying to find fixes for**|", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.918}, {"ranking": 0.8484848484848485, "comments": "[Schefter] Former Cardinals\u2019 TE Zach Ertz cleared waivers today and is now free to sign with any team, per source.

I think we\u2019ll do just fine out there. \n\nDallas is fortunate that Seattle\u2019s defense is bad and playcalling questionable or they would have lost.

Harbaugh saying that Tyus is not even ready to open his return window, which would give him 3 weeks to practice and return or be shut down for the year, is not a promising outlook. Tyus said in mid-October that he was feeling great and moving around well. It\u2019s been a strange situation.\n\nThe Ravens can save $5.5 by cutting/trading him after this season while taking on $2 million in dead cap money. Hopefully everything is alright and he will rebound next year whether it\u2019s with the Ravens or on another team.\n\nRecap (Information from Raven's media/reporters Jamison Hensley, Jonas Shaffer, Jeff Zrebiec, Sarah Ellison, Ryan Mink, Brian McFarland):\n\n* **5/22/23** \\- Bowser did not participate in Day 2 of OTAs (first one open to media).\n* ***6/15/23*** \\- Harbaugh says Bowser is dealing with a knee issue but that he should be ready for camp\n\nRavens OLB Tyus Bowser should be ready for training camp after working off to the side on the final day of minicamp.\n\n\"He was rehabbing full speed,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \"When he came back, his knee flared up.\"\n\n* ***7/21/23*** \\- Bowser is placed on the Non-Football Injury (NFI) list. Injury is not thought to be serious at this time and he is expected back.\n* ***7/26/23*** \\- Harbaugh did not share a timeline for Bowser's return when asked but did say it is a reasonable timeline. \"It's hard to categorize it but Tyus is dealing with a side issue to his recovery. No set backs. Tyus's achilles is fine. With that some times other areas can compensate and get a little sore. That's what we're dealing with.\"\n* ***8/14/23*** \\- Harbaugh says Bowser has time to be ready for season opener. Added that he is dealing with an agitated knee but the knee is responding well. \"They feel good about it... I think they're being cautious\"\n\nRavens OLB Tyus Bowser's knee has \"looked the best it's looked\" in terms of swelling, the trainers told John Harbaugh.\n\n\"I know he'll be back for the season,\" he said. \"There's not a serious problem in there. It's just him getting right for him to play to his highest level.\"\n\n* ***8/28/23*** \\- Harbaugh admitted there is some ambiguity with OLB Tyus Bowser's status. Harbaugh said he's hopeful Bowser will be ready within first 3 wks of regular season. He wouldn't say, though, whether that meant Bowser wouldn't start on Reserve/NFI, where you'd have to miss first 4 weeks. \"Its with the doctors and Tyus.\"\n\nTyus Bowser, who is on NFI list, was working out on an adjacent field.\n\n* **8/29/23** \\- Bowser is placed on Reserve/NFI and will miss first 4 games. Ravens will recover $250,000 for each game Bowser misses (potentially up to $4.5 million for the whole season). While on NFI, contracts only tolls in the last year of the deal. 2024 is Tyus's last year on his deal.\n\n\u201cTeams can work something out with players \u2018on Reserve/NFI list\u2019 (like they did with Nick Moore and I believe Vorhees and Mullen) but I don\u2019t believe they have in bowser case.

Based on his conversations with trainers, they're in the realm of practicing.\n* **10/4/23** \\- Tyus Bowser working out on adjacent field during practice\n* **10/11/23** \\- Tyus Bowser, who remains on NFI list, was again working out but still hasn\u2019t been activated.\n* **10/16/23** \\- John Harbaugh said he's going to let OLB Tyus Bowser (non-football injury list) address his status.\n\n\"That's gotten a little more complicated over the last couple of weeks, I'm not in liberty to talk about it right now. Some point in time I'm sure I'll have an announcement on that one way or another\" Harbaugh said. \"He's got to make some choices and decisions.\"\n\n* **10/18/23** \\- Harbaugh said Tyus Bowser has doctor meetings this week that could lead to a resolution. Said he\u2019d like Bowser to return, but he believes the ball is in his court and Bowser has a decision to make\n\nJohn Harbaugh on Tyus Bowser: \"I really want what's best for Tyus. I want this to get resolved. Because he's really worked hard to get physically where he can come back and play. He's worked really hard to do it. I think there are some doctors meetings going on this week, so I'm really looking forward to seeing what the resolution is. I'm hopeful that he gets back and plays. That's what you want. It's going to be in his court, I think. That's my understanding of it. We'll just see what happens. Those are real decisions guys have to make.\"\n\nTyus says on his radio show \u201cI\u2019m feeling great. I\u2019m on the field, I\u2019m moving around very well, just gaining more and more confidence each and every day. \u2026 I feel like myself, it\u2019s getting to that point. I\u2019m just going to continue to work hard and when that time comes, it comes.\u201d\n\nAsked if he\u2019s coming back this season, Bowser said, \u201cTrust me, if I can play, I\u2019ll definitely play. That\u2019s the goal.\u201d\n\n* **10/23/23** \\- Harbaugh said there's no resolution to Tyus Bowser's status.\n* **10/25/23** \\- In team locker room, Ravens LB Tyus Bowser politely declined any comment about his status when asked by reporter.\n\nJohn Harbaugh has previously deferred comments on the situation to Bowser. He remains on the NFI list.\n\n* **11/27/23** \\- Harbaugh said when Tyus Bowser\u2019s knee calms down, he\u2019ll be out there. Added that he is trying to get the knee where it can handle the loading and swelling. He is dealing with an \u201cangry knee\u201d which is kind of hard to decipher. Also, added that if and when the team gets him back it can be a huge bonus.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5560tes50s3c1.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d6fcf47fb694851076068a929a735f5428f7fea", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9948}, {"ranking": 0.6, "comments": "Will the ravens dolphins game be flexed?

We drafted a successor at ILB, in theory, last year, and can again use mid-rounders for depth/development. Our WRs should be okay for a year - Flowers looks great and Bateman could use more targets. \n\nOn the other hand, LT is a clear weakness, and it\u2019s a strong OT draft. We may have to trade up slightly to get the guy we want, but depending on other teams\u2019 behavior, a really good one could fall to us - a guy that would normally be the second LT off the board could be the 4th or 5th.

Marlon told on his podcast how everyone on the team knew that this guy was insanely fast as soon as he showed up. Even the fans could see that there was something about that guy from the few carries he got in the preseason. \n\nSo why did he get stashed on IR only to start getting limited snaps halfway through the season?\n\nSure he could have actually been injured, however I don't buy it. the practice of putting completely healthy players on IR to protect them from getting signed off of the practice squad is an open secret in the NFL. This was probably an example of that considering 6 weeks being out is an extremely long time to sit out without a serious injury. But why did the Ravens do that? We lost JK week 1 and we really could have used him at the beginning of the season. A blind man could see that he is a lot more talented than the guys we were putting out there like Kenyan Drake and Melvin Gordon. Why did Gordon make the 53 man roster over him? \n\n\nMy theory is that his contract has a **per play** bonus system. I just learned that it is pretty common in UDFA contracts and it would explain a lot if that is why the Ravens have been so reticent to lean on him. If he is getting an extra 2k per snap, which is what former Packers QB and current content creator Kurt Benkert was getting, that can rack up pretty quickly if he were to get 40 snaps per game in a season. The Ravens would be paying him close to a 2nd rd rookie rbs salary if this is actually the case, and potentially far more if his per play bonus is higher than Kurts was. \n\nThis is just my reading the tea leaves theory.

The more people feel like they are a part of the action, the more likely they are to come back, buy merch, watch games, etc. So I can see why they are really over the top with that.

A number of my esteemed fellow Mafioso say it ain't so - because there are 5 teams ahead of the Bills for a wildcard spot, and each will presumably hold the conference record tiebreaker over the Bills. Here's what that argument misses:\n\nFirst, two of those teams are unlikely to make 10-7. The Broncos have only a 13% chance at 10+ wins (using Upshot's per-game win probabilities); they most likely lose to the Texans, Lions, and at least once to the Chargers. The Colts have a 30% chance; they're favored only against the Raiders (although the model may not account for the Bengals' new QB*).\n\nAlso, there are 16 ways for only 2 (or fewer) of 5 teams to go in the 10+ win bin, and the probability of each way contributes to the total. When you note that, for example, the probability of only the Steelers and Texans winning 10+ is 12%, it's not hard to see how there's a better than even chance that those 5 teams leave a seat at the playoff table for a 10-7 Bills team.\n\nOf course, we'd all rather see the Bills make this moot by winning out.\n\nGo Bills!\n\n(*EDIT: I just checked what happens if I specify a Colts win over the Bengals - the 10-7 Bills' playoff chances drop by only a few percent.)", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": 0.9842}, {"ranking": 0.6470588235294118, "comments": "How it feels this next week ", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.6470588235294118, "comments": "Our latest podcast: Von, McDermott (again) and thoughts going forward.

These posts are intended to provide Bills Mafia with rationale behind who they should root for in **every** game in **every** week of the NFL regular season. Included is the *Game Importance Scale* which rates each game from \ud83d\udc4f (Least Important) to \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f (Most Important). Future editions of this series will be posted each week on Wednesday by 9:00AM ET.\n\nTies and injuries are not considered in this discussion. Tiebreakers that are considered for overall standings are as follows:\n\n1. **H2H:** Head-to-Head\n2. **WLC:** Win/Loss in Conference\n3. **WLG:** Win/Loss in Common Games (min 4)\n4. **SOV:** Strength of Victory\n5. **SOS:** Strength of Schedule\n\n# Week #12 Review\n\nMoving on as quickly as possible from the heart-breaking loss in Philly, Week #12 was a weird week for Rooting Interests. The Bengals, Texans, Browns, Raiders, and Chargers all lost which while good came at the expense of Steelers, Jaguars, Broncos, Chiefs, and Ravens victories. Add to that the Colts finding a way to win a 1-score game against the Buccaneers and what could have been an OK week for the Bills was one that was much closer to meh. Now in the Bills Bye Week though Rooting Interests are as important as they have ever been with Buffalo needing at least some help moving forward if they want to sneak into the playoffs.\n\n***Rooting Interests Record:*** *61-85 (LW 6-9)*\n\n***Rooting Interests*** \ud83d\udc4f ***+/-:*** *-49 (LW -10* \ud83d\udc4f*)*\n\n# Seahawks @ Cowboys (Thursday 8:15PM) \ud83d\udc4f\n\nThough it is becoming more and more unlikely by the week, SOV/SOS remains a feasible tiebreaker for the Buffalo Bills. For that reason, in games such as this we root for the teams the Bills have played or will play. The Bills don\u2019t play the Seahawks in the regular season this year but will host the Cowboys on December 17th. Root accordingly.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Cowboys Victory*\n\n# Colts @ Titans (Sunday 1:00PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nDetailing the Colts path to 6-5 would require an entire post so for the sake of Rooting Interests all you need to know is they have one less loss than the Bills. Detailing the Titans path to 4-7 is much simpler, they just aren\u2019t a very good football team. This week Bills fans should be rooting for that not very good team to take down a surprisingly good team, a result which would provide Buffalo with some very realistic backdoors into the playoffs.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Titans Victory*\n\n# Chargers @ Patriots (Sunday 1:00PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nIn the grand scheme of things this game won\u2019t matter all that much for the Bills with both the Chargers and Patriots at or past the 7-loss mark. That means we need to step a bit outside our typical rooting interests and dig a bit deeper. While a loss by the Chargers basically eliminates them from the playoffs it\u2019s the win by the Patriots which makes this the optimal outcome. New England winning every game, except for 1, moving forward is good for the Bills by reducing their draft stock and keeping some of the top quarterback prospects out of Foxborough.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Patriots Victory*\n\n# Lions @ Saints (Sunday 1:00PM) \ud83d\udc4f\n\nLuckily for us there is but one game this week that is a good old fashion NFC only non-Bills opponent matchup. In those games we look to the SOV impact on other AFC teams to determine the optimal outcome. In that context the Lions have lost to the Ravens and beat the Chiefs, Raiders, and Chargers while the Saints have lost to the Texans and Jaguars while beating the Titans, Patriots, and Colts. With it being far more likely that SOV is a utilized tiebreaker against the Texans than the Ravens the optimal outcome of this game is predetermined for us.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Lions Victory*\n\n# Falcons @ Jets (Sunday 1:00PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nAt 4-7 with Tim Boyle starting at Quarterback the Jets season is all but over. But wait, there\u2019s still a path for them to make the playoffs. The Path would involve them winning out while a few things fell their way including a handful of Bills losses particularly against teams like the Patriots and Dolphins. Let\u2019s nip this in the bud while we can and root for the Falcons to down the Jets and in the process essentially extend their playoff drought to 13 seasons.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Falcons Victory* \n\n# Cardinals @ Steelers (Sunday 1:00PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nOne of the bigger games for Bills fans to monitor this week will require the Mafia to root for one Kyler Murray. The Cardinals are a somewhat competitive team as of late which is good news considering the Steelers are trying to slide into the playoffs over the Bills. A Kyler Murray led victory, no matter how it is achieved, is optimal for the Bills and quickly would raise the odds Buffalo can still go on a playoff run.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Cardinals Victory*\n\n# Dolphins @ Commanders (Sunday 1:00PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nThe AFC East title is not yet out the window, but it\u2019s getting close. Buffalo desperately needs Miami to drop a couple games before Week 18 and likely will need at least one to come in surprising fashion. Can the Commanders surprise the Dolphins? Probably not, but they do have some solid defenders and a Quarterback that CAN turn it on and compete. Maybe this is the week the Dolphins embarrass themselves? Bills fans really hope so.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Commanders Victory*\n\n# Broncos @ Texans (Sunday 4:05PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nThis is the most difficult game to decide the optimal outcome for because both teams currently sit ahead of the Bills in the wildcard standings. At 6-5 the Broncos have 1 fewer loss than the Bills but their H2H win over Buffalo pushes their overall lead closer to 1.5 games. The Texans also sit at 6-5 with a 3-3 conference record, better than the Bills 3-5, making them almost as dangerous as the Broncos. The optimal outcome here is based on which tie breaker holds more weight, that would be H2H, making a loss by Denver the better option in this game.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Texans Victory*\n\n# Panthers @ Buccaneers (Sunday 1:00PM) \ud83d\udc4f\n\nWe take the same approach to this game as we do Seahawks @ Cowboys on Thursday night. Buffalo unfortunately won\u2019t face the Panthers this season but did take down the Buccaneers in Orchard Park. That means a win by the latter provides Buffalo with an SOV and SOS boost, which though minute is optimal.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Buccaneers Victory*\n\n# Browns @ Rams (Sunday 4:25PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nThere is some very real hope that this matchup may just go Buffalo\u2019s way. Led by their defense Cleveland has just 4 losses on the season but with a sputtering offense there are very real concerns that they can maintain that pace. Meanwhile, the Rams are coming off their best performance of the season, a 37-14 trouncing of the Cardinals. Can Los Angeles pull off the upset here? Let\u2019s hope so.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Rams Victory*\n\n# 49ers @ Eagles (Sunday 4:25PM) \ud83d\udc4f\n\nThis game has next to no meaning but with 6 weeks left in the season there is without a doubt an optimal outcome. Buffalo won\u2019t see the 49ers in the regular season but did play the Eagles in one of the best games of the 2023 season. That means there is a minor SOS boost here, though unimportant, it is optimal.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Eagles Victory*\n\n# Chiefs @ Packers (Sunday 8:20PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nWe are digging really really deep here but there is still an unrealistic possible scenario where Buffalo is competing with the Chiefs for seeding and/or a playoff spot. If Kansas City drops a few games down the stretch, as crazy as it seems, the Broncos could catch them and push them into the Wildcard convo. There is also the chance they win the division and Buffalo somehow comes away with the AFC East crown. While it\u2019s ok to doubt either of those occur a loss on Sunday night begins to make each more realistic, root for that.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Packers Victory*\n\n# Bengals @ Jaguars (Monday 8:15PM) \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nAfter the Jaguar\u2019s Week #12 win over the Texans, they all but locked up the AFC South. That means there are few scenarios where we should root against them moving forward. This week we root for them to down the Bengals and, in the process, basically eliminate them from the playoff race. Less teams in the playoff race means more chances at the playoffs for the Bills.\n\n***Optimal Outcome:*** *Jaguars Victory*\n\n# Optimal Standings\n\nIf all the above games were to go the optimal route, it would result in the following AFC standings (All tiebreakers considered).\n\n1. Jaguars (9-3, 7-2 WLC)\\*\\*\n2. Ravens (9-3, 6-3 WLC)\\*\\*\n3. Chiefs (8-4, H2H Win over MIA)\\*\\*\n4. Dolphins (8-4, H2H Loss to KC)\\*\\*\n5. Texans (7-5, H2H Win over PIT)\\*\n6. Steelers (7-5, 3-1 DIV, H2H Loss to HOU)\\*\n7. Browns (7-5, 3-2 DIV)\\*\n8. Colts (6-6, 4-4 WLC)\n9. Broncos (6-6, 3-5 WLC, H2H Win over BUF)\n10. Bills (6-6, 3-5 WLC, H2H Loss to DEN)\n11. Raiders (5-7, 3-5 WLC)\n12. Titans (5-7, 2-6 WLC, H2H Win over CIN)\n13. Bengals (5-7, 1-7 WLC, H2H Loss to TEN)\n14. Chargers (4-8, H2H Win over NYJ)\n15. Jets (4-8, H2H Loss to LAC)\n16.

Serious question. I\u2019ve been a die hard fan of this team for 40 years.  I grew up with the 4 Super Bowl losses. I watched every game featuring the likes of Rob Johnson, Drew Bledsoe, JP Losman, Trent Edwards. I believed in coaches named Dick Jauron, Chan Gailey, and Rex Ryan. I literally cried when Andy Daulton hit Tyler Boyd for a miracle TD that broke the drought for us. I don\u2019t EVER remember feeling this level of disappointment and embarrassment regarding this team. The drought years were tough, but the birth of the mafia made it fun. I almost miss the days of having no expectations. At least when we had epic choke jobs then, it was to be expected and the rest of the league basically ignored us. The expectations have been sky high for 4 years now and we have delivered year after year of embarrassing failure when it matters most.  And now this year. That Eagles game was the exact same script as 13 Seconds. Too many men on the field.  Losing to the Jets. Being sky high after the Miami win, only to have a complete fucking meltdown in London, while losing our best defensive player. Losing to Mac fucking Jones! Josh looks like an MVP and has somehow been branded as a liability by the national media. What a wasted opportunity. What a wasted season. And now Von Miller being a POS is the icing on the cake.

I think he is the defensive version of Mike McCarthy. I am preaching to the coir here but at the same time it needs to be said in collective with how the fanbase feels. \n\nSomeday, I think in this cursed city of Buffalo, Terry Pegula will be sitting at his desk  at one Bills drive pondering how he could never win the big one, and the entire time the answer has been in front of him. Coaching and play calling has not been good enough. Simply put, it hasnt. Look at the last three seasons and it just hasnt been good enough. Last two seasons Dorsey handicapped this offense. It truly does look so incredibly fluid with Joe Brady at the helm and I hope he stays long term, even if the Bills hire an offensive coach.\n\nLooking at the last decade in the nfl one thing is clear, if your name is not Bill Bellicheck with Tom Brady as your QB, no defensive head coach has won a superbowl. Ever think about that? Sean McVay was hired one day after McDermott and won a superbowl with a lesser QB despite the Bills by all means having more talent every where other than defensiveline. \n\nIt isnt clutch, it isnt any of that, Sean McDermott folds when the game is on the line. He plays the coward, the I dont want to lose because of me going for it and the NFL has passed him by. Josh allen is flat out generational, there is not a single qb with his skill set. Pat Mahomes might have the arm but he aint jumping over 6'5 linebackers. Yet Sean can not win when it matters, he consistently gets outcoached.\n\nThe fanbase deserves to win and Brandon Beane built this roster to win, sure he over payed for Von Miller, but he acquired great talent all around this team.  Best secondary in the nfl for a multi-year period, acquired a top 5 receiver in the game, has a top 10 ish oline, has a top 10 tight end in the nfl, has  good running back in james cook, every where other than cb2 this team has great players and yet Sean couldnt beat the fucking Jets on opening night. \n\nIf we never win a superbowl, Terry Pegula is going to regret wasting the greatest quarterback that has ever graced this team.", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9635}, {"ranking": 0.6470588235294118, "comments": "Poor situational defense Not including the Jets game 2 weeks ago , which was a blowout, the Bills' last 5 opponents have converted 19 First Downs when there has been less than 3 minutes left in the game.

Mac seems to always try and force a play to work when things break down, and the result is always catastrophic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYes, the line isn't always awesome, but Mac doesn't take a whole ton of sacks - instead, he's close to the league leader in INTs. Instead of getting outside the tackles and throwing the ball away, or throwing the ball at the feet of an eligible WR, Mac will try and force the ball to his first or second read, often off his back foot. He often bails on clean pockets too, making the offensive line look worse. A good way to help tackles out is to step up in the pocket, allowing the tackles to simply re-direct the rush behind the pocket. A lot of starting QBs do this well and often, and Mac doesn't. Of course, pressure up the middle makes this really hard to do, which is why having decent to good guards and a great center is critical. We have a really good center. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other issue Mac has is that (this showed up vs New Orleans a lot) - he sets his protection wrong a lot of the time, so when the rush comes, it's from the least advantageous direction it could come from - usually the opposite side of whoever his hot read should be. Now, this could also be Andrews, as I'm not sure if Mac or Andrews is handling protections.

It's that time of the week for another full breakdown of the teams you should be rooting for ideal draft positioning.\n\nWeek 12 was amazing for our draft chances and almost went perfectly for us. If you followed my last weeks thread, almost every critical game broke the Patriots way. The Titans beat the Panthers, the Packers beat the Lions, the Bears beat the Vikings, Falcons beat Saints, and we somehow lost to the Giants! The only team that didn't really help us out was the Cardinals who lost to the Rams but fingers crossed they can pull one out this week.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bq01g6hewh3c1.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3340ca4f6aee848ac65d8564f5db1a70cf92b993\n\nAs things currently stand your New England Patriots have the **#3 PICK** in the 2024 NFL Draft. The Cardinals, by virtue of playing and losing one more game than us, have the **#2 PICK**. That said, for tiebreakers our strength of schedule is worse than the Cardinals meaning that if we end up finishing with the same record as them we will pick ahead of them.\n\nAnother critical thing to consider for pick watching is that there are no longer any teams in the NFL with 3 wins. This means that a  win by the patriots going forward would actually not change our  draft position as we have a 'game in hand'. With all that said lets get to the week 13 slate!\n\n# THURSDAY NOVEMBER 30th 8:15PM SEAHAWKS @ COWBOYS\n\nWe have a good matchup to start the week with the Cowboys hosting the Seahawks tonight. Going forward our strength of schedule tie breaker is more and more critical to determining if we pick #2 or #3 assuming we win the same amount of games as the Cardinals. Therefore, since we played the Cowboys this year, Patriots fans should root for the **SEAHAWKS** to defeat Dallas.\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 1:00PM COLTS @ TITANS\n\nAs mentioned previously there are no longer any 3 win teams in the NFL. There are however 7 four win teams, the Titans being one of them. A win by the Colts slightly hurts our strength of schedule, but a win by the Titans brings them to 5 wins further distancing themselves from us for a top 3 pick. Call me paranoid but at this point I think we should still be rooting for the **TITANS** to defeat the Colts this weekend. One game matters less for strength of schedule but it could matter a lot to our pick if we miraculously win a couple games.\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 1:00PM FALCONS @ JETS\n\n[Fuck the Jets](https://preview.redd.it/gu6ujvw0yh3c1.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fcbc153c9620ef9da930f45afe193d02faae3925)\n\nWhat a doozy this one is. The Falcons march into Metlife up against whatever suckbag QB the Jets decide to rotate in. That said the Falcons would have a losing record in pretty much any division and have QB problems themselves. This is a similar scenario to the colts/titans game where you have a 4 win team you want to win but S.O.S would really be benefitted by a Jets loss. Ultimately I think a Jets win here would keep them in the playoff picture and maybe rush rogers to come back. Reluctantly I suggest **THE JETS** should win this game. \\*\\*EDIT I have changed this to  Jets win after second thought. SOS &lt; getting the Jets to 5 wins here.\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 1:00PM LIONS @ SAINTS\n\nA straightforward one here. We faced the Saints so a loss by them would help our strength of schedule for draft tiebreakers. We should hope the **LIONS** take care of the Saints this week.\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 1:00PM BRONCOS @ TEXANS\n\nThe Broncos have miraculously turned their season around after starting off horribly. The offense at least seems to have figured it out. That said Patriots fans should root for CJ Stroud and the **TEXANS** to stomp the Broncos this week for SOS purposes.\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 1:00PM CHARGERS @ PATRIOTS\n\n[Seeing this man play might be the only exciting thing of the day for Pats fans.](https://preview.redd.it/8dwusbkwxh3c1.jpg?width=1296&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=30ad8918954eee37c5e6ee5541e11af501c32cb0)\n\nBrandon Staley has been a disaster this season for the Chargers who are bizarrely 4-7 despite a good roster on paper. If he somehow loses to the Patriots this week he should be immediately fired and not allowed within 3 miles of a football field for the rest of his life. While we have a game in hand of a top 3 pick it is still very important for us to lose out so it could be possible for us to blowout the Jets in the last game of the season and still get the #2 pick. Mainly because that would be hilarious. **CHARGERS** over Pats.\n\n# GAME OF THE WEEK Dec 3rd 1PM CARDINALS @ STEELERS\n\n[Come on Kyler, we believe in you!](https://preview.redd.it/s5kvd74owh3c1.jpg?width=640&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c2c546b69feba356100fbf18505473bc54504481)\n\nThis game is the most important for Patriots fans to keep an eye on. A win by the Cardinals here and we could be locked into the #2 pick. We also currently edge out the Cardinals in a potential tiebreaker for a better pick. The Steelers schedule has really been a cake walk the entire season and I think they are a little worse than their record indicates. They remind me of how the Patriots could be if they were healthy and just had a functional offense.\n\nThe Cardinals now have Murray back so they are at the very least functional and can move the ball. The Steelers should probably be slight favorites here but I wouldn't be surprised at all if the Cardinals picked up a win. A **CARDINALS** win would be enormous for our odds at the #2 pick.\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 1:00PM DOLPHINS @ COMMANDERS\n\nOf all the games this week this is certainly...one of them. The Dolphins have shown they are the class of the AFC East and The Commanders, while floundering at 4-7 may have stumbled upon their QB of the future after years of listless bozos at the position. Lets hope for a **COMMANDERS** win against the Dolphins to help our S.O.S.. (The commanders play the Jets later in the season so one of those teams will move to 5 wins..Not concerned about them catching us in the tank-off)\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 4:05PM PANTHERS AT BUCCANEERS\n\n[We need this man to out suck Bryce Young](https://preview.redd.it/8xpeiiq7xh3c1.png?width=345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f30101707e09280d20d893b64c2f7d8f5bebf5f9)\n\nI almost put this game as the game of the week but ultimately felt a cardinals win would be more impactful to us. While the Panthers have only 1 less win than us they look locked in to the strength of schedule tiebreaker. We would likely need to lose out and have them win two more games to have a shot at the #1 pick. While not impossible it certainly does not appear likely. That said their schedule is easy and they have no incentive to tank so who knows. If they get a win here then their games immediately become more important to watch going forward.\n\nThe Bucs meanwhile are 4-7 themselves and struggling to get any momentum with Baker Mayfield. Hopefully it stays that way and the **PANTHERS** shock the world and win a game this weekend.\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 4:25PM 49ERS @ EAGLES\n\nGreat matchup here with two legit superbowl contenders. An Eagles loss helps the Patriots due to strength of schedule. **49ERS** over Eagles\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 4:25PM BROWNS @ RAMS\n\nThis is one of the few games this week that truly does not matter in relation to our draft pick. The Rams are now at 5 wins and even with my paranoia see no shot at us hitting 5 wins by the end of the season. Who should win? **Whoever you'd like.** (I have Puka in Fantasy so maybe the Rams please)\n\n# SUNDAY DECEMBER 3rd 8:20PM CHIEFS @ PACKERS\n\n[Packers kinda look good? Surely they will beat the Chiefs for us.](https://preview.redd.it/3akx7acfxh3c1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9882060aae6e257fb3f20310cfc1d2cf7c8c56fb)\n\nThe Chiefs this year seem to be kind of just floating around and winning games from the sheer talent at QB and a good defense. Their WR core is dreadful and if they did not have Kelce you could argue it would be the worst in the league. What I'm getting towards is that the Packers *might* have a shot here. They played really well against Detroit and I think they could keep that momentum against the Chiefs here. Certainly a **PACKERS** win against the Chiefs would help us out for our SOS.\n\n# MONDAY DECEMBER 4th 8:15PM BENGALS @ JAGUARS\n\nAnnnnd the week 13 slate ends here. A meaningless game for our draft pick really. Although it would honestly be funny if Trevor Lawrence choked against the Burrow-less Bengals. **BENGALS** over jags.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**TLDR WHO SHOULD I ROOT FOR?**\n\n**SEAHAWKS** over Cowboys  \n**TITANS** over Colts  \n**JETS** over Falcons  \n**LIONS** over Saints  \n**TEXANS** over Broncos  \n**CHARGERS** over Patriots  \n**CARDINALS** over Steelers  \n**COMMANDERS** over Dolphins  \n**PANTHERS** over Bucs  \n**49ERS** over Eagles  \n**PACKERS** over Chiefs  \n**BENGALS** over jags\n\nIt will be tough to beat last week's results but lets see.

Honestly for me I'm good with either quarterback. Williams would give us a dual threat who can not only throw the football but one who can also use his legs to get out of trouble either to throw it to someone else or run it himself on a design run. Plus Caleb even if he plays in such a style that can be seen as backyard football, he would be perfect in our system especially if Belichick stays on as coach or if we get an entirely new coach, Williams in New England would it really be the worst thing that can happen? \n\nWith his comps of Caleb being compared to Mahomes in terms of his playing style, how can you not want him in Foxboro? I mean sure he has an attitude or he can be a diva in terms of wanting a piece of ownership. But if he is as good as projected and lives up to the hype then again why wouldn't you want him on this team?\n\n\n\nHowever, would I want Drake Maye on this team? Of course I would because he too like Caleb is a dual threat who can throw the football also and he can run using his legs too. But he's more of a gunslinger type QB and is that a good thing? Of course it is especially if you want a QB who is accurate with his throws and reads. The attitude is not there and the ego is not there which of course are pluses in my book.\n\n\n\nIt really comes down to just which QB falls to us when we pick but out of these 2, who do you want ultimately as a New England Patriot?", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.85}, {"ranking": 0.42424242424242425, "comments": "How I Would Fix The New England Patriots Step 1: Bill must go (GM Bill not Head Coach Bill!)\n\nThis step is simple. First we must clone Bill Belichick using hair from his hoodie. Then, once we have two Belichicks, we can name one GM Bill and one Head Coach Bill. Simply fire \"GM Bill\" and then reap the benefits.\n\nStep 2: Draft a player in the first round\n\nI think we should draft a consensus top 3 pick that all the professional scouts have identified. This may shock you, but allow me to provide an example of this scenario: Suppose we are drafting number 3 overall. If Caleb Williams and MJH get taken, we should draft Drake Maye.\n\nStep 3: Sign good free agents\n\nI have a theory that I thought of: If we have better players than the other teams, we might beat them. So we sign good people, especially at positions we need.\n\nStep 4: Trade for Mike Evans\n\nA player like Jerry Jeudy could help us win. Hollywood Brown is a the perfect trade target. Indeed, once we trade for Randy Moss, we will definitely win more. In conclusion, we should trade a 5th for Patrick Mahomes.\n\nStep 5: Win more games\n\nIf we stop losing they can't beat us.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9934}, {"ranking": 0.42424242424242425, "comments": "SAVING PAT.

You've all seen it: \"we shouldn't draft a qb because that wouldn't immediately fix our offense and that guy still wouldn't have a wr to throw to or tackle to protect him\"\n\nThere are two points on this argument that I hope will stop this nonsense once and for all:\n\n1) If your standard for your first round pick is that he has to fix everything right away then you have only one option at draft day: don't pick any player at all and just give up. No team that is as bad as the Pats right now will ever fix their team with one single rookie, no matter how high you draft him. This would also mean no MHJ and no Joe Alt because they would not fix everything either.\n\n2) You can make the second part of the argument above about literally any position ...\n\n\"Oh you want to draft a wr? But who is going to throw him the ball?? And who is gonna protect that guy??\" \n\nOr \"oh you want to draft a tackle? But who is gonna throw the ball and to whom??\" ... etc. etc. \n\nIt really shouldn't be hard to understand that fixing one of the three major holes on offense inevitably leaves the other two open. But you obviously have to start somewhere, so why not with the one position that's usually hardest to get and most valuable (if you happen to have such a high pick)?\n\nSo does that mean that it's qb or bust? No, there are (potentially) legitimate arguments for not taking a qb. For example, if you think that the qbs in this class are overrated and MHJ is sure-fire generational then that's a good reason to go with the latter. Or if you believe that there is not such a huge gap between maye and qbs available later then let's for one of those later qbs. But pleeeeease for the love of god, don't use the annoyingly irrational argument described above.
