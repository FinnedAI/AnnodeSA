Mario Lemieux: One of the greatest hockey players ever, Lemieux co-founded the Penguins and had a remarkable career, winning multiple scoring titles and two Stanley Cups.\n\n2. Sidney Crosby: The face of the franchise since his entry, Crosby led the Penguins to three Stanley Cups and has numerous individual accolades, including multiple MVP awards.\n\n3. Jaromir Jagr: A dynamic winger, Jagr played a crucial role in the Penguins' back-to-back Stanley Cup wins in the early '90s and is one of the highest-scoring players in NHL history.\n\n4. Evgeni Malkin: A key part of the Penguins' success alongside Crosby, Malkin has won multiple scoring titles and played a pivotal role in two Stanley Cup victories.\n\n5. Paul Coffey: One of the greatest offensive defensemen, Coffey's time with the Penguins saw him contribute significantly to their Cup victories in the early '90s.\n\n6. Ron Francis: A highly skilled and consistent player, Francis was instrumental in the Penguins' Cup wins, providing leadership and offensive prowess.\n\n7. Tom Barrasso: A standout goaltender for the Penguins during their Cup victories in the early '90s, Barrasso's performance between the pipes was crucial to the team's success.\n\n8. Marc-Andre Fleury: The franchise's all-time winningest goaltender, Fleury played a key role in three Stanley Cup championships and was a beloved figure in Pittsburgh.\n\n9. Kevin Stevens: A power forward, Stevens was a key part of the Penguins' success in the early '90s, combining physical play with offensive contributions.\n\n10. Kris Letang: A cornerstone on defense for the Penguins, Letang has been a key contributor to multiple Cup victories, showcasing skill and leadership.\n\nThese rankings consider factors such as individual skill, leadership, impact on team success, and overall contribution to the Penguins' legacy.", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9955}, {"ranking": 0.5126582278481012, "comments": "Phil Kessel game worn Been looking for a kessel gamer for awhile now.

Ekholm did a lot for the Oilers in our last playoff run but when he's been struggling defensively the holes in Bouchard's game heavily shine through.

The AHL players we have might become a Hanifin type player but they may not. Solovyov looked lost when he got called up, Poirier/Kuznetsov look good but the NHL is a huge step up from the AHL. I thought DeSimone looked solid his time up here. \nSo if we move Hanifin that leaves one of DeSimone/gilbert/solovyov/Poirier/Kuznetsov/oesterle and tanev to be our second pairing. If one of our 1st line defenders gets injured or tanev inevitably gets injured. We will have 2 third pairing guys as our 2nd pairing. Oesterle and gilbert don't look like they will break the third pairing. So that leaves us banking on an AHL guy taking a huge step forward. \nIf we can lock up Hanifin for 8 years at 7.5 I feel like that will be a decent contract in a few years if the cap goes up.

I\u2019m a freshman in college in the US and one of my best friends in my dorm is a huge Hockey fan. He\u2019s from New Jersey so he roots for the Devils. I only know them because he told me who they were like an hour ago after the upset some other team and he was excited. I\u2019m from Austin, Texas so I have never watched Hockey before. I don\u2019t know any of the rules and the only Hockey player I know is Wayne Gretzky. The only hockey teams I knew prior to today were the Dallas Stars and the Toronto Maple Leafs because Drake posted about them on Instagram. Normally I root local, but I refuse to root for any Dallas sports teams because fuck that city, South and Central Texas only (Austin, San Antonio, Houston). I worked with my friend to find a team that I feel like I have a connection to and that isn\u2019t a \u201cbandwagon\u201d team. I decided on the Vancouver Canucks because my parents\u2019 all time favorite vacation was their 2 week honeymoon to Whistler, BC. Obviously Vancouver is also in BC, so I went with the Canucks as a tribute to my parents. Plus I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s a beautiful city and one of my current favorite YouTubers JJ McCullough is a Vancouver native. I\u2019m a fiercely loyal and competitive sports fan, so once I pick a team I\u2019m ride or die for that team no matter what. No switching up, whether we\u2019re the best or worst team in the league. Anyways, I don\u2019t know shit about hockey. I haven\u2019t watched a single game or even highlights. I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s really fun to watch and very exciting though. I don\u2019t know any of the rules, I don\u2019t know a single current player on the Canucks or in the NHL in general, I don\u2019t know how the regular season or playoff format works, and the only NHL teams I even know the names of are the Stars, Maple Leafs, Devils, and now my Canucks. I\u2019d appreciate any sort of insight into Canucks team history like fan favorite players, greatest team moments, current players, if we\u2019re a good team RN in comparison to the rest of the NHL, big rivalries with other teams, players the fanbase hates, and any general insights into NHL stuff I just don\u2019t know.

What else needs to be done to actually improve next year's roster? Assuming Petey is re-signed, it'll be Petey, Miller, Suter, Aman down the middle. Aman's $825k would replace Blueger's expiring $1.9m, which has been some quietly tidy business.\n\nCapfriendly projects us with $30m for 2024-2025. But with rumors that Petey's ask is $12m and Hronek $8m, that's ~$10m left to replace the other expiring UFAs: Beau, Joshua, Lafferty, Cole, Myers, Friedman, and DeSmith.\n\nBy position that's 3LW, 4LW, 4RW, 2LD, 2RD, 3RD, and 2G.\n\nEven in the best case, min contract forwards, Bear fills 3RD at $1.5m, Silovs ready, re-signed $1m, that's $4m at best for 2LD and 2RD. IMO they'd be in \"everything goes right\" mode to just maintain the status quo of this year.\n\nTrading a winger, any winger, with no cap back probably needs to be on the table. Plus a breakout year from a prospect. That seems like the minimum they'd need to have happen to have a chance at actually improving the roster, which is still pretty average at 5v5 and on the PK. Obviously, they'll try to negotiate down for Petey and Hronek, but I can't see them saving a whole lot that way, maybe an extra $500k below their ask, but not enough to upgrade the tier of any UFA player they'd be able to sign or any player they can target in a trade.\n\nThey've been pretty creative and efficient in putting this year's roster together. What's the next trick?\n\nGimme hot takes too. If Hronek won't sign for under $8m, trade him for like...two smaller Hroneks.

It looks like they're doing pretty well? \n\nAs of writing this they're 4th on the division by a couple of games. How many teams make the playoffs at the end of the year? Also what stats are important when evaluating how good a player is? \n\nAnd I know I'm really really late to this news but we traded O'Reilly??? He was one of the few names on the team I could mention. How did Blues nation react to that trade? And also, did we get any good players/prospects from it? \n\nLastly, are there any good story lines to follow this season with the Blues or NHL in general? \n\nThanks,\nSincerely a bandwagon fan.", "date": "20231123", "sentiment": 0.9912}, {"ranking": 0.5225806451612903, "comments": "Game Thread: St Louis Blues (9-7-1) at Arizona Coyotes (8-8-2) - 22 Nov 2023 - 8:00PM CST [](/2023020287)\n\n**[Link to comment with all tables.](/r/stlouisblues/comments/181encb/game_thread_st_louis_blues_971_at_arizona_coyotes/kabpquu/)**\n\n# St Louis [](/r/stlouisblues) Blues (9-7-1) at Arizona [](/r/coyotes) Coyotes (8-8-2)\n\n#Mullett Arena\n\n##In-Game Updates\n\n***\n\n|Time Clock|\n|:--:|\n|FINAL|\n\n|Teams|1st|2nd|3rd|Total|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|2|3|1|6|\n|[ARI](/r/coyotes)|2|3|0|5|\n\n##Team Stats\n\n|Team|Shots|Hits|Blocks|FOW%|Giveaways|Takeaways|Power Play|PIM|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|31|16|15|64.5%|6|5|0/3|6|\n|[ARI](/r/coyotes)|25|13|13|35.5%|9|3|0/2|18|\n\n##Goals\n\n|Period|Time|Team|Strength|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|1st|08:47|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|Even|[Brayden Schenn (6) backhand shot, assist(s): Jake Neighbours (1)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341635005112)|\n|1st|10:40|[ARI](/r/coyotes)|Even|[Nick Bjugstad (4) wrist shot, assist(s): Matias Maccelli (11)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341634935112)|\n|1st|12:15|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|Even|[Colton Parayko (3) slap shot, assist(s): Brandon Saad (3)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341635891112)|\n|1st|18:06|[ARI](/r/coyotes)|Even|[Jason Zucker (4) wrist shot, assist(s): Michael Carcone (3)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341636025112)|\n|2nd|00:22|[ARI](/r/coyotes)|Even|[Lawson Crouse (9) wrist shot, assist(s): Matias Maccelli (12), Nick Bjugstad (9)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341635751112)|\n|2nd|03:40|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|Short Handed|[Nick Leddy (2) backhand shot, assist(s): Kasperi Kapanen (5)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341638014112)|\n|2nd|04:13|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|Short Handed|[Alexey Toropchenko (4) wrist shot, assist(s): Justin Faulk (10)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341635466112)|\n|2nd|06:56|[ARI](/r/coyotes)|Even|[Michael Carcone (7) wrist shot, assist(s): Alex Kerfoot (5), Travis Boyd (6)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341636069112)|\n|2nd|08:00|[ARI](/r/coyotes)|Even|[Nick Schmaltz (5) wrist shot, assist(s): J.J.

It's no secret that the Wild have been struggling this season and Dean Evason as head coach was the primary reason why they were underperforming. Dean lead the team to the Playoffs and a first round exit last season. Not ideal, but with the cap hell the Wild are going through, this was frankly on the high end of an expected outcome.\n\nThe off-season seemed to go well with Faber and Rossi commiting to their development, but problems became apparent early in the preseason. We all saw it. Some spoke out about it, but many, like myself were hesitant to admit it was a problem I til well into this disappointing season. \n\nDean let his hair grow too long. That sowed doubt and chaos into the team which lead to their current record. Now Bill has hired a coach so bald that Middleton could use the reflection of Hynes' head to floss his last 7 teeth. This is clearly an over correction. I expect our neutral zone performance to suffer greatly as the glare bouncing of the new coaches' done impairs their vision. \n\nHopefully Hynes can grow some head stuble or find a nice hat to wear.

Very small sample size but Gus looking good confirms the theory that the goaltenders didn't magically suck but actually had terrible defense in front. Gus played stellar but was not left to dry.\n\nAlso: Boldy, Spurgeon and Gaudreau all looking much better. Which is weird since Gaudreau was acquired because of Evason.\n\n\nNot much we can actually attribute on Hynes.\n\n\nHowever, the question remains on whether firing Evason was the right move.\n\nPersonally I liked his gritty style, the Wild were very fun to watch under his leadership\n\nBut objectively, if we look at the facts:\n\n- Evason's grit first strat it doesn't seem to be as efficient as other strats (see the playoffs against the Stars, penalties killed us)\n\n- He had totally lost control of the squad (look at the non-verbal of the team on their last game with Evason and their first game with Hymes)\n\n- Special teams has always been an issue\n\n\n\nAll in all though, what is done is done.

Was really looking forward to see the franchise grow under his leadership.\n\n\nFor now, let's hope that Hynes warmer (that congratulation friendly tap to Boldy was never seen from Evason) , more technical (and boring) style of coaching sends the Wild back to another first round exit!", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.9844}, {"ranking": 0.560126582278481, "comments": "John Hynes is 1-0 as Head Coach of the Minnesota Wild.

Zucc/Hart/Foligno re-signings\n2. why we've been so bad this early season\n3. coaching change\n\nIn order: \n\nUp until these guys were extended, Guerin had been public and vocal about WAITING until mid-season to see how things went. For those wanting verification, this was referenced again by Russo on his recent Athletic mail-bag: \"Guerin indicated he'd wait to extend the three big pending free agents like there was no rush and he wanted to see how the season played out.\" In these same recent mail-bag articles, he then discusses how Leipold continuously resists committing to a rebuild; \"he wants to make the playoffs every year, and that's what \"nudges\" Guerin to always be in a win-now mode.\" Russo even posited after that comment that this may be the reason for that those contracts were already re-signed. \n\nI think Russo's right here. Guerin was given the edict by his boss to keep as competitive as possible, so the gamble became: re-sign all three of these guys now at a discount, with the presumption that if we had another playoff-caliber season, they would each demand enough in free agency that we'd only be able to retain 1-2 next year. He did this also knowing that Zucc was still an elite playmaker, and that Hartman's contract was very reasonable for a guy who can play center or wing, special teams, and up and down the line-up, and has the capability to be a 20-25 goal guy every year. \n\nI still bash GMBG for the Foligno signing. It was either the correct term but wrong AAV, or correct AAV but wrong term. I favor the latter; I would have rather had his AAV for a shorter (2 year) deal, recognizing that year 3-4 he'd be pushed into a 4th line role anyways (so why overspend there?!)\n\nOther's have already discussed point #2 in detail, and I agree with the hive mind on this sub. Our studs (Kap &amp; Boldy) aren't scoring, we aren't getting secondary scoring from our defense like we normally expect, our special teams is historically bad, and even though our shot suppression is very good, our goalies are letting in everything. I'm a little sad that Dean got the axe here, but am happy that our D and special teams coaching is getting a change. \n\nWhich leads to point #3. It's been clear that even during GMBG's good times, he's heavily leveraged his prior connections to facilitate trades and hirings. I don't fault that for him - I recognize that good relationships in business can be tough to build. But the NHL is chocked full of nepotism hires, and I WISH that we had appointed Darby as temporary head coach and then given it a little more time over the next couple weeks to find a right-fit coach for remainder of the season. Are some of these hires also an attempt to retain coaching leadership that leads to the safest 'floor' (i.e., higher likelihood of making playoffs again?) I think that's true, beyond coach speak. \n\nIf Leipold was fine with a tank, I think Guerin would not have re-signed all three right away, and we'd be in a spot now where we'd be trading away a couple assets, firing/hiring assistant coaches, and then riding out Evanson through rest of the season, though he'd be on the hot-seat. In other words, GMBG has made blunders/questionable decisions this year, though I think the context to much of this is due to pressure from his own boss. \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9952}, {"ranking": 0.560126582278481, "comments": "Game Thread: St Louis Blues (11-8-1) at Minnesota Wild (5-10-4) - 28 Nov 2023 - 7:00PM CST [](/2023020330)\n\n**[Link to comment with all tables.](/r/wildhockey/comments/1869mjm/game_thread_st_louis_blues_1181_at_minnesota_wild/kb6nb9w/)**\n\n# St Louis [](/r/stlouisblues) Blues (11-8-1) at Minnesota [](/r/wildhockey) Wild (5-10-4)\n\n#Xcel Energy Center\n\n##In-Game Updates\n\n***\n\n|Time Clock|\n|:--:|\n|FINAL|\n\n|Teams|1st|2nd|3rd|Total|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|1|0|0|1|\n|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|2|0|1|3|\n\n##Team Stats\n\n|Team|Shots|Hits|Blocks|FOW%|Giveaways|Takeaways|Power Play|PIM|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|23|12|13|57.6%|6|4|0/4|2|\n|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|37|15|25|42.4%|9|7|0/1|8|\n\n##Goals\n\n|Period|Time|Team|Strength|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|1st|02:41|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|Even|[Joel Eriksson Ek (11) snap shot, assist(s): Mats Zuccarello (17), Jared Spurgeon (1)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341937388112)|\n|1st|10:30|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|Even|[Colton Parayko (4) wrist shot, assist(s): Sammy Blais (5), Alexey Toropchenko (3)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341937604112)|\n|1st|18:10|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|Even|[Frederick Gaudreau (1) wrist shot, assist(s): Pat Maroon (8), Marcus Foligno (6)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341939413112)|\n|3rd|17:08|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|Even|Matt Boldy (2) wrist shot, assist(s): Jonas Brodin (8)|\n\n\n##Penalties\n\n|Period|Time|Team|Type|Min|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|1st|00:22|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|MIN|2|Brock Faber high-sticking against Oskar Sundqvist|\n|1st|07:27|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|MIN|2|Marco Rossi hooking against Oskar Sundqvist|\n|2nd|04:35|[STL](/r/stlouisblues)|MIN|2|Oskar Sundqvist tripping against Jake Middleton|\n|3rd|07:55|[MIN](/r/wildhockey)|MIN|4|Matt Boldy high-sticking-double-minor against Oskar Sundqvist|\n\n\n**Officials**\n\n* Referees: Kelly Sutherland, Ghislain Hebert\n* Linesmen: CJ Murray, Matt MacPherson\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Time\n\n|PT|MT|CT|ET|AT|UTC|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|5:00PM|6:00PM|7:00PM|8:00PM|9:00PM|1:00AM|##Game Info:\n\n|||\n|:--:|:--:|\n|TV|BSMW, BSN, BSWIX|\n|Other|[Preview](https://www.nhl.com/news/st-louis-blues-minnesota-wild-game-preview-november-28) - [Boxscore](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/2023020330/boxscore) - [Recap](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/2023020330/recap)|\n|GameCenter|[On NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/2023020330/playbyplay)|\n\n\n\nThe bot can only be as correct as its sources, the sources it uses are linked below each table.

I may be in the minority here, but Yeo was my favorite Wild coach behind Lemaire. Only two coaches that have ever won playoff series for this franchise. If Hynes can get the Wild some playoff series wins, that\u2019s a massive step ahead of what we had with Deano.\n\nPreds and Devils fans rip into Hynes about stunting growth of their young stars. The same thing could be argued with Evason and the alarming downwards trends of Kaprizov, Boldy, JoJo and others this year. Evason was the definition of underwhelming. Do we not remember how good special teams were before this guy arrived? We were almost always in the top third of the PK, sometimes, the top five.\n\nHave the Wild had one game this year where they went 100% on the PK? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that one game into the Hynes experiment, the PK magically looked somewhat competent. Every time the opposing team got a PP under Evason, you knew the opposing team had a coin flips chance at scoring at a goal.

He extended people that there were questions about extending. This team needed players to keep having career years. It needed certain players to stay healthy. There wasn't the depth in place, a problem of the Wild's own devising with their buyouts. \n\nThey were running it back with a team that wasn't good enough in the first round, as if \"bounces\" were going to get them further this postseason.

So, you're Bill Guerin with the mindset that the Wild still have time to get their shit back together and make the playoffs. With this being the team's 7th straight loss with recurring problems that have yet to be fixed, how on Earth do you stick with Evason? He has no answer for this team and just seems to have lost the room all together. In fact, many people have recently pointed out the differences between decisions made by Evason this year and the decisions made by winning coaches. Now, not all the Wild's problems are on Dean, but he has still played a huge role in this terrible season. And with all the contract extensions and NMCs given out over the summer, getting rid of Evason is really the only move that could truly impact the season.

What the fuck is the reason for starting games vs East Coast teams an extra 30 minutes later than normal?!\n\nAnyway, hopefully the guys can start scoring goals again.\n\n#LUCKY GUESS\n\n* **1 Point**: Final Score (indicate winning team)\n* **2 Points**: Game Winning Goal (GWG) scorer\n* **3 Points**: Total Shots for both teams combined\n\nGood luck everyone!\n\nPrevious Answers:\n\n* @SJS: 2-1 SJS, Luke Kunin, 0:24-4:24 into the 1st period\n\n#Leaderboard\n\nUser|Nov Points|Nov Correct Guesses|Season Points|Season Correct Guesses\n-|-|-|-|-\nmark\\_dink\t\t\t|11\t|4\t|16\t|7\nJollyRancher29\t\t\t|9\t|3\t|14\t|6\nMrSchnuffles\t\t\t|8\t|3\t|11\t|4\nHiddenbehindawall\t\t|8\t|3\t|9\t|4\nphishy21\t\t\t\t|7\t|3\t|9\t|4\nAquaPat\t\t\t\t|7\t|3\t|8\t|4\nQuintessentialK\t\t\t|7\t|3\t|8\t|4\ncapslfc\t\t\t\t|7\t|3\t|7\t|3\nUnderCoverDoughnuts\t|6\t|3\t|10\t|5\nLevelheadedfan1989\t\t|6\t|2\t|6\t|2\nIn\\_Senity\t\t\t\t|5\t|2\t|12\t|5\nwoodmanalejandro\t\t|5\t|2\t|6\t|3\nalstod\t\t\t\t|5\t|2\t|5\t|2\nsovietdoginspacea\t\t|5\t|2\t|5\t|2\nTjotimmy\t\t\t\t|4\t|3\t|4\t|3\nkevingh92\t\t\t\t|4\t|2\t|10\t|5\nmdkss12\t\t\t\t|4\t|2\t|7\t|3\nSilverPaco\t\t\t\t|4\t|2\t|4\t|2\nEggsEgg\t\t\t\t|4\t|2\t|4\t|2\nNo\\_Numbers\\_\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|11\t|5\nhere4thememes420\t\t|3\t|1\t|7\t|3\nMister_Dwill\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|7\t|3\nrobi1k819\t\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|7\t|3\nplantedgreenfern\t\t|3\t|1\t|6\t|2\nDisastrous-Wealth\t\t|3\t|1\t|6\t|2\ndanimalhollocaust\t\t|3\t|1\t|6\t|3\nKmac326\t\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|3\t|1\nKiksav33\t\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|3\t|1\npearls137\t\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|3\t|1\nAddCapitals\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|3\t|1\nGlassCityGal\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|3\t|1\nMrYeaBuddy\t\t\t|3\t|1\t|3\t|1\nalejandrowoodman\t\t|3\t|1\t|3\t|1\nzombiereign\t\t\t|2\t|2\t|2\t|2\nStarfishSanseveria\t\t|2\t|1\t|8\t|3\nt\\_rooster\t\t\t\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\nTheLastArizona\t\t\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\neighty1percenta\t\t\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\nFilthyPeasanta\t\t\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\nDXPBladeza\t\t\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\nB\\_E\\_A\\_R\\_J\\_E\\_W\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\nFatBoySpeaksa\t\t\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\ntauntaunsnuggiea\t\t|2\t|1\t|2\t|1\nyour_pizza_guy\t\t\t|1\t|1\t|8\t|4\nadiscgolferp\t\t\t|1\t|1\t|4\t|2\niggy555\t\t\t\t|1\t|1\t|3\t|3\nYellowMarkerIsGreat\t\t|1\t|1\t|3\t|2\ndoodoobrowntown\t\t|1\t|1\t|2\t|2\nalwaysjetlagged\t\t\t|1\t|1\t|1\t|1\nJoeInMD\t\t\t\t|1\t|1\t|1\t|1\nbpw4h\t\t\t\t|1\t|1\t|1\t|1\nDJ_Rupty\t\t\t\t|\t|\t|9\t|4\nSodaTherapy\t\t\t|\t|\t|8\t|4\nDudeFoSho\t\t\t|\t|\t|4\t|2\nGreat-Gardian\t\t\t|\t|\t|4\t|2\nDaniCapsFan\t\t\t|\t|\t|3\t|2\nkomputernik\t\t\t|\t|\t|3\t|1\nCarlLingus\t\t\t\t|\t|\t|3\t|1\ncgoodCSGO\t\t\t|\t|\t|3\t|1\nParker511\t\t\t\t|\t|\t|2\t|2\nbdruby\t\t\t\t|\t|\t|2\t|1\nadmire816\t\t\t\t|\t|\t|2\t|1\n\\_masterofdisaster\t\t|\t|\t|2\t|1\nZanderK8\t\t\t\t|\t|\t|2\t|1\nrplesterrr\t\t\t\t|\t|\t|1\t|1\nbleached_n_tiedyed\t\t|\t|\t|1\t|1\nTheReasho\t\t\t|\t|\t|1\t|1\nEntertainmentguru\t\t|\t|\t|1\t|1\nDhaliwal30\t\t\t|\t|\t|1\t|1", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.8513}, {"ranking": 0.4738562091503268, "comments": "Ovi Wtf is going on", "date": "20231130", "sentiment": -0.5859}, {"ranking": 0.4738562091503268, "comments": "Another angle of Wilson\u2019s hit ", "date": "20231129", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.4738562091503268, "comments": "Wilson deletes Addison / repost from r/nhl ", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.4738562091503268, "comments": "When did CSN Washington rebrand to Monumental Sports Network? + Commentator Appreciation I\u2019ve been watching the capitals off a streaming website ever since I left for school a few years ago since I\u2019m out of the Washington market but, while I was home for thanksgiving I saw that CSN is now monumental.

", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.5, "comments": "Hey Dad, what did Lou do with all our draft picks? He called 2 Bettman's scrap heap! As we all know, Lou in his pursuit of a cup has left our prospect pool barren, largely in part due to trading our past 4 consecutive first round draft picks. Given that first round picks have given some great Islanders, including Griffin Reinhart, Rick DiPietro, and of course EFLWFRDPAS Josh \"DP\" Bailey, its clear how trading away four straight might do some damage to the future of an organization. While dreading the boys inevitably blowing their lead last night (s/o Barzal for the OT winner), I got curious thinking how different this organization would look if those trades weren't made and we held onto those picks. As a refresher, the trades involving our first rounders were:\n\n* JGP for 2020 1st and 2020 2nd\n\n* Palmieri and Zajac for 2021 1st, A.J. Greer, Mason Jobst, and 2022 4th\n\n* Romanov for 2022 1st (Traded to CHI by MTL for Kirby Dach)\n\n* Horvat for 2023 1st, Anthony Beauvilier, and Aatu Raty\n\n\nThe players acquired with those first rounders are:\n\n* 2020 1st (28th overall, selected by the Sens) - [C Ridly Greig](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/413174/ridly-greig)\n\n* 2021 1st (29th overall, selected by the Devils) - [RW Chase Stillman](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/503174/chase-stillman)\n\n* 2022 1st (13th overall, selected by the Blackhawks) - [C Frank Nazar](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/574819/frank-nazar)\n\n* 2023 1st (17th overall, selected by the Red Wings) - [RD Axel Sandin Pellikka](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/534818/axel-sandin-pellikka)\n\nFor completeness sake, here are the other two picks that were traded:\n* 2020 2nd (59th overall, selected by the Maple Leafs) - [LW Roni Hirvonen](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/448946/roni-hirvonen)\n\n* 2022 4th (110th overall, selected by the Devils) - [LD Daniil Orlov](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/665898/daniil-orlov)\n\nSo far, Ridly Greig is the only one out of the group with any sort of NHL playing time. He debuted for the Sens last season after playing fairly good offense in the AHL where he scored at a 0.744 point-per-game (ppg) pace over 39 games played. He kept up the good scoring in the big league, putting up 9 points in 20 games (0.45 ppg), and was off to a hot start this year with 7 points in 9 games (.778 ppg) until he was injured on November 2nd and was just moved to LTIR yesterday. Regardless, he was playing middle-6 minutes, getting time on the PP, and seems to be a promising player for the Sens moving forward.\n\nChase Stillman was by some sources a surprising pick at 29 OA, as many scouts had him ranked somewhere between the late second and fourth rounds. In fairness to the Devils, they had 3 firsts and 0 seconds in 2021 putting them in a position to reach. Currently in his first year of pro puck, he has 7 points in 14 games (0.5 ppg) with the AHL's Utica Comets. He put up almost identical numbers the 2 years prior in the OHL, scoring 49 and 48 points in 59 games (0.831 and 0.814 ppg), respectively. These numbers are nothing to scoff at, but does have [a faction of Devil's supporters disappointed](https://pucksandpitchforks.com/2023/09/14/can-devils-fans-separate-zach-parise-heartbreak-accomplishments/) that one of their first round picks not only couldn't hit &gt;1 ppg is his final year of juniors, but couldn't even match his point total for the year prior despite being traded midway through the season.\n\nRoni Hirvonen is the last of these players old enough to evaluate in any sense at this time. He's spent the past 2 seasons in his native Finland. His 28 points in 57 games (0.491 ppg) this season with HIFK of La Liiga represent a decrease in production from his 26 points over 46 games (0.565 ppg) the year before which were accompanied by an impressive performance at the U20 WJC. The Hockey News ranked him as [the Leafs #2 prospect entering this season](https://thehockeynews.com/nhl/toronto-maple-leafs/news/maple-leafs-prospect-rankings-2-roni-hirvonen), and he seems to project as a smart defensive-minded middle-sixer, a prototype which Islanders fans have become all-too familiar with under GM Lamoriello.\n\nThe other 3 players are still very early into their careers; Frank Nazar is enjoying a productive year at Michigan with 17 points in 16 games (1.06 ppg), Pellikka is playing his first full season the Swedish men's league (SHL), and Orlov is trying to earn his playing time on his KHL team. With the graduation of many of Chicago's top prospects to the NHL, Nazar has found himself at the [top of their prospect rankings](https://www.bleachernation.com/blackhawks/2023/12/01/updated-bn-blackhawks-top-20-prospect-rankings-lots-of-hot-skaters-heading-to-december/) and Pellikka could become the [highest scoring U19 SHL defenseman since Ulf Sammuelsson in 40 years ago](https://detroithockeynow.com/2023/11/18/sandin-pellikka-shl-detroit-red-wings-prospect-scoring-record/)\n\nTo clean up the loose ends, [AJ Greer](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/151125/a.j.-greer) earned his first full time spot in the NHL last season at the age of 25 with the Bruins and is currently playing for the Flames. [Mason Jobst](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/101415/mason-jobst) appears to be a career AHLer, playing with the Rochester Americans this year. [Anthony Beauvilier](https://www.eliteprospects.com/player/213435/anthony-beauvillier) has continued to show the disappointing lack of progression he did as an Islander, recently being traded to the Blackhawks. Finally, Aatu Raty has been playing at a similar level for Vancouver's AHL team as he played in Bridgeport last season as he struggles to earn an NHL job.\n\nIt's too soon to know the impact the players selected with the traded draft picks will have in the NHL. We might've missed out on a stud or two with these trades, but none of the players taken with an Islanders draft pick would've been reasonably expected to make a positive impact in the window that the current core of the Islanders (excluding the acquired players) provides. The 4 players we've received in return are all contributing middle-6 forward/top-4 defenseman level play, and although inconsistent none of them have been a complete waste of roster space. The somewhat unexpected conclusion I've drawn from this exercise is that at this moment in time Lou's mistakes have not necessarily been in what he traded away, but rather not receiving younger talent that would help extend our window and the above-market contracts that he gave the players he acquired. Of course young NHL players with potential to grow would've been more expensive, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a single Islanders fan that wouldn't rather have gotten two young stars than the four guys we got.\n\nLGI", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.9891}, {"ranking": 0.5, "comments": "\"Good Vibes Only\" thread (things to be positive about, but yeah, fire Lambert LOL) I'm very happy with Holmstrom's and Varly's season so far.

To fully evaluate, I went through each NHL team, looking at their current NHL goalies as well as their 3rd goalie/AHL goalie to evaluate who could use Primeau. \n\nI separated them into 4 categories.\n\nWould not claim\n\nPretty self explanatory. These teams all have NHL level goalies who are better options than Primeau. While some may be interested in Primeau, they wouldn\u2019t have space for him on their NHL roster without moving an existing goaltender. The only way I see any of these teams claiming Primeau is an injury.\n\nHighly unlikely \n\nThese 4 teams all have veteran NHL goalies with young backups. They could claim Primeau and send their backup to the AHL without needing waivers, but each of these teams value the development of their existing #2 at the NHL that makes it unlikely they claim Primeau. \n\nUnlikely \n\nSimilar to the previous category, these teams could add Primeau, but they would have to waive their existing backup to make space. You could argue whether those respective teams should, Prosvetov and Martin were claimed to fill Primeau\u2019s role, and Daccord and Brossoit, are on teams vying for the playoffs who likely wouldn\u2019t want to gamble on Primeau.\n\nPossible\n\nEach of these teams could create a space for Primeau quite easily, and would have varying levels of interest in upgrading the position. Philly have a crowded net already, but Primeau\u2019s age and connection to the city could have them interested. Edmonton is desperate but there\u2019s no guarantee that Primeau is an upgrade, and it would push Rodrigue out in the AHL. The Devils may be the most likely, but they view themselves as a contender, and Primeau is unlikely to truly make a difference this season, which is their priority. \n\nObviously all it takes is one team, and management clearly has their reason to believe Primeau would get claimed, but I see few teams with a spot where he could truly succeed, and the added value Primeau would have if he cleared, has me believe it is worth the risk, even if it results in losing him for nothing.

I know everyone is *losing their minds* right now asking who we go to since nobody believes in our current tandem, so let me provide a statistical defense of Kotchetkov:\n\nPK is currently at a 2.93 GAA with a .878 SV%.  This is, on its face, not good.  It's not *atrocious* but it's not good.  However, that stat is not indicative of the current state of the team.  Allow me to explain.\n\nPK started 2 games in October and replaced Raanta in one as well, on the 19th, 21st, and 24th.  If you have been following this team, you will remember this was the dead center of the TDA/Orlov defensive line fiasco, where *nothing* on our defense was looking good.  His stats for those 3 games leave him with a 4.33 GAA and an .838 SV%.  Now *that* is a bad stat line.\n\nNow we come to November.  For the month of November, on 6 games, he has a 2.30 GAA with a .899 SV%, which short of Saros, Vasi, or Ulmark, you're not finding much improvement on at the moment.  Now allow me to take it one step further.\n\nKotchetkov had a *very* rough night last night, and anybody who will deny that is out of their minds.  Yes the defense let a good amount of Grade A chances through, but Kooch should have had at least a handful of those (2 and 3 come to mind).  He had a **bad** game.  HOWEVER, if we take the *single* game from last night out of his stats for November, and only calculate the 5 prior games he started since the beginning of November until today, we get the following:  **GAA 1.60 and .929 SV%**  \n\nThose are the kind of numbers that win a cup.\n\nNow some of you will say I'm cherry picking stats and that I need to count his entire body of work or that I need to count last night as well.  That's fair, the stats are the stats.  The conclusion I'm trying to make is this: PK is young, and will still have bad nights, but the talent is there, and he shows it more often than he doesn't.

Sadly, the most upvoted comment there foolishly suggested a ridiculous claim that these stats suggest TDA was directly part of every Hurricanes Power Play goal this season. Of course not. \n\nThis post is not presented as a proof with a conclusion. Random chance and statistical anomalies may explain the following. I would suggest however other factors including player chemistry, locker room morale, confidence in the system, on ice decision making, being less predictable, and creating favorable conditions such as exhausting the opponent's best penalty killers or creating offensive zone faceoffs are also plausible explanations for these stats.\n\nAlso please note this is not a call to bench Chatfield, play 11 forwards with 7 defense, or to try TDA with someone other than Orlov. I am here with stats, not to play coach or GM.\n\nFor the person asking how important a good power play is to winning the Stanley Cup, I added some playoff stats.\n\nFor the person mentioning Burns scoring a goal a second after a power play ended, the stat balances out with the power play goal against Tampa Bay which was directly off a faceoff win.\n\nFor the person who brought up advanced stats, none are included here because when I checked against the entire league I found situations such as TDA given a -3.6 Expected +/- and then Steven Stamkos also at -3.6.

Hi there, this is Corey Masisak. I am the new-ish Avs beat writer for the Denver Post.\n\nNow that I've been on the job for about two months, it's time to start up a monthly mailbag. At my previous stop (The Athletic, covering the Devils, then the Sharks), the mailbags were a lot of fun.\n\nThere isn't a great way to ask for questions on the Post's website, so I'm starting here: Avs fans, hit me with your questions in the comments below. Whatever's on your mind about the Avalanche, the NHL or whatever else is on your mind.\n\nI'll try to answer as many of them as I can. Some of them will end up in the paper, and a longer version will be online. I'm looking forward to the mailbags being a recurring staple of our coverage moving forward.\n\nIf you've seen my tweets or my Instagram feed (both are also at cmasisak22), you've probably noticed that I enjoy food and being in/around the mountains quite a bit. So the new job/getting to explore the area has been pretty amazing!\n\nThank you to everyone who has been reading so far, and for any questions that you've got for me here.\n\nEDIT: Here's the link to the mailbag.

He's is coming off one of the best U21 seasons in Phantoms history (only 4 players had more points, and only 2 had a higher PPG) so expectations were reasonably high. But so far this season he has as many points as Morgan Frost who has missed half the team's games, he is one of only two Flyers forwards (along with Deslauriers) without an even strength goal, and he has fewer points this season than in his 8 game call up last season. But, as is often mentioned on the broadcast, Foerster is doing everything else right. Analytically Tyson Foerster has been one of the Flyers best forwards this season.\n\nAmong Flyers forwards at 5v5 this season, Foerster ranks:\n\n* 1st in Expected Goals For %\n\n* 1st in High Danger Goals For %\n\n* 1st in Fenwick For %\n\n* 2nd in Corsi For %\n\n* 2nd lowest offensive zone start percentage (combing faceoffs and on the fly starts)\n\n* 5th in High Danger Chances For %\n\nWhile you might be able to assume this from his lack of production, it is the defensive stats that are driving Foerster's high rankings in these categories. He is first or second in xGoals Against/60, Goals Against/60, Corsi Against/60, Fenwick Against/60, and High Danger Chances Against/60. \n\nI think a lot of people would be quick to point out that Foerster's defensive numbers could be inflated playing with Sean Couturier, but the data provides some interesting insight. Foerster and Coots have played a little less than 40% of their 5v5 minutes with each other, in that time they took the lions share of defensive zone draws. When separated Foerster and Couturier have roughly the same TOI, roughly the same OZS, and roughly the same quality of teammate, with Foerster either having a slight increase in most categories, or having less of a drop compared to Couturier. I'm not going to say Foerster is carrying Coots, Coots' numbers are still really good and have been really good his whole career, but just wanted to show Foerster isn't merely a passenger. \n\nSo what does this all mean? I chose this point to talk about Foerster's advanced stats because now that we are a quarter of the way through the season the numbers will be more representative, but it is still a small sample size. While his defensive numbers are great it's not like we can project him out to be an elite defensive player from 20 games, though even going back to when he was drafted he was thought of as a solid defensive player. He hasn't gotten any PK so far this season, while I don't think he will see much given the strong crop of defensive forwards I would like to see him start getting work in those spots. Not only because of his good defensive numbers and his ability to get a good stick on puck carriers, but because of Foerster's ability to score goals by finding soft areas and getting a quick release he could be a good candidate for someone who scores a bunch of PK goals. Not scoring off the rush the way we see someone like TK score PK goals, but having a speed guy force the turnover and skate the puck into the offensive zone then look for Foerster finding the soft area.\n\nIt is ok to still be a little upset at the lack of production, given his skill set Foerster should eventually be a 30 goal player, even this year I was hoping (or kind of expecting) him to hit 20 goals or at least get pretty close. All those skills are still there, the production will come. But the most encouraging thing about Foerster's advanced stats this season is that is showing the potential development of a type of player who is key to teams competing for the Stanley Cup. \n\nThese types of advanced numbers are not very common for someone at this point in their career. Even given his production struggles, Foerster has remained a guy who can drive play at a high level. If the production comes and Foerster turns into a 25-30 goal guy who gets between 50-60 points he could be what Ondrej Palat was to the Lightning, or Nichushkin to the Avs, DeBrusk to the Bruins, or Karlsson for Vegas. Players that are not first liners but are able to drive play, produce a good amount, all while on a fairly inexpensive contract. Not only does the contract provide flexibility, but it makes a team's overall line up more formidable. The First line is the star line (presumably Michkov/Gauthier) and the third line is the shut down defensive line (with either Cates or an older Coots), the second line is where a lot of tough playoff series will be won and lost, and having a player like Foerster, who is showing early signs of being able to drive play on a very high level even if he is not putting up a ton of points, could make a future Flyers second line a very tough match up for anyone.", "date": "20231125", "sentiment": 0.9947}, {"ranking": 0.346875, "comments": "The value of Deslauriers ", "date": "20231125", "sentiment": 0.34}, {"ranking": 0.346875, "comments": "Rangers Rangers fan coming in peace.

Some Interesting Numbers After last night's win, I was curious how many games the CBJ had a lead in last year total compared to this year so far. This led me to some interesting numbers that verify that we are in fact much \"closer\" than last year, and confirm the eye test that we have been passing in many games (Until we give up the lead).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast year the CBJ had:\n\nThe lead going into the 2nd only **21** times all season.\n\nThe lead going into the 3rd only **13** times all season.\n\nThis year so far (**23 games**) the CBJ have:\n\nThe lead going into the 2nd, **11** times.\n\nThe lead going into the 3rd, **7** times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo in only \\~quarter of the games, we have already gotten to \\~half of last year's totals for leads. For this year that is on pace for \\~**44** games where we have a lead after 2 periods and **28** games where we have a lead after 3 periods.\n\nAnother stat that shows we have fast starts, so far in **23** games this year, we have scored **26** goals in the 1st period... All of last year we only had **56** goals in the 1st period.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFinally, the stat that blew me away:\n\nLast year the CBJ were in **9** one-goal games(wins and losses) total.\n\nThis year so far we have been in **6** one-goal games(wins and losses).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTake all of this how you want, be it that last year was just that historically awful and any competent team would improve from that, or that the CBJ are making improvements and are much \"closer\". I know that half the team was the Cleveland Monsters last year, but this is a big enough jump to show me this is not just \"Last year's healthy team\". To me, this confirms what I have been watching, and we are truly in these games. We have played some pretty good teams so far this year and have stuck with them. Getting the lead is one of the first steps, now we just need to shut it down better, late in games.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReference: [https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/CBJ/2023\\_situational.html](https://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/CBJ/2023_situational.html)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGO JACKETS!", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9825}, {"ranking": 0.3515151515151515, "comments": "Now Chinakhov may want out and is unhappy with Jarmo ", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": -0.3612}, {"ranking": 0.3515151515151515, "comments": "[Portzline] J.P.

Hi all! I\u2019ll be direct and straightforward. \n\nI\u2019m an LA Kings fan that lives in SoCal. I truly enjoy getting to visit away games when I can and finally get to cross another exciting city off my list. Planning to attend the Kings @ BlueJackets game next week in Columbus and had some general questions:\n\n1) Any recommendations for a first timer attending the venue? I haven\u2019t bought my ticket yet and would definitely like an insiders advice on a good place to sit. I\u2019m easygoing and like making conversation with opposing fans and don\u2019t mind the pressure of being the fish out of water at a game. It\u2019s always fun time when we all love the same sport. \n\n2) Speaking of ticket... I was going to buy mine off the team website but would much rather buy one off fellow hockey fans who may be trying to get rid of one of their own before I hand my cash over to the transaction-fee-vampires. Are there any fan/ticket exchange/seller groups on here or social media? \n\n3) General advice about visiting Columbus? Haven\u2019t been and would love insight on things to do, unique food recommendations, coffee shops, bars, etc.? I\u2019m going solo and am always open to hearing locals out and making friends! I\u2019m open to any insight. \n\n4) Hotel recommendations/neighborhoods/safe areas near some ambient nightlife or good food spots? \n\n5) Also! Easiest way to get to Columbus from Cincinnati? I\u2019m visiting Cincy first to catch the MLS Conference Final. Wondering what the best way of commuting over might be. Bus? Rail? Rental? Magic Flying Reindeer? \n\nAny other input, suggestions\u2026 I\u2019m always up for hearing!

As a result, they\u2019re completing few passes, turning the puck over in open ice and having to defend without giving themselves time to get organized.\n\nSkating the puck *anywhere but north* and completing east-west or south passes for *no apparent purpose* is anthesis to CBJ\u2019s tactical identity. Delays, change-of-sides and long regroups won\u2019t even help CBJ win more games in the short term. But at least they\u2019ll give their (many) skilled players more rhythm with the puck and more clarity without the puck. Maybe the investment pays off in the longer term?\n\n\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI think this nails it on the head. We have all seen how bad this structure can be, but also how good it can be when it works. The problem is still getting it to work.\n\nWhat I have shared is from Jack's free emails that he sends out from his newsletter.

I\u2019ve spent the majority of my life elsewhere and Columbus is the closest NHL market I live nearest to (aside where I moved from). I like the city, been to a few games in the past (including the ASG) at Nationwide. My wife and I are Reds fans so we\u2019re already used to making trips up that way. My team is Tampa Bay. I say this as a Lightning fan: we\u2019re spoiled and I hope we enjoy this run. \n\nSince I live within arm\u2019s reach and like going to Columbus more than Nashville, I\u2019ve decided to start paying more attention to the Jackets. I\u2019ve always admired the fan base. Lesser people and lesser markets would\u2019ve quit twice over (see \u201cAtlanta\u201d). \n\nTL,DR: I\u2019m starting to pay attention to the CBJ. \n\nHave the Columbus Blue Jackets ever had an elite puck-moving defenseman? Seth Jones is the closest answer, but never truly elite. What\u2019s separating the good from the bad in today\u2019s NHL is being able to exit the zone. The Bolts\u2019 titles can be attributed to amazing passing, stellar goaltending, and a defense that blocks shots when needed and moves the puck well. The Avalanche defensemen play very well with the puck and can be trusted to carry the load. \n\nSo I ask: has Columbus ever had \u201cthat guy\u201d or a few B+ guys at one time? And is there a prospect on the blue line that could be that guy? \n\nIf you see a long-haired hillbilly w/ Kentucky plates, say hi.", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9744}], "winnipegjets": [{"ranking": 0.5308641975308642, "comments": "/r/WinnipegJets Ticket Marketplace | December 2023 Sell tickets, buy tickets, ask questions about tickets.

Hello, Jets fans! First, we would like to thank the mods for allowing us to share our league with you.\n\nI have been tasked with extending an invitation to the members of the Jets subreddit. Why me? I am the General Manager of the Winnipeg Aurora, one of the top teams in the Western Conference of the Simulation Hockey League. Our home ice is Northern Lights Arena, which we named after Canada Life Center lost its naming rights in our own little universe.\n\nThe Simulation Hockey League is a free simulation hockey league about to enter its 74th season! You can create a character and take control of every aspect of your career. From the creation of your character, there are tasks you can participate in every week to earn points that go towards improving your player's performance. With the conclusion of our most recent season comes the off-season activities, including the Simulation Major Junior Hockey League's (SMJHL) Entry Draft, the initial stepping stone for your player. You will be drafted to one of 14 excellent SMJHL teams! You'll spend your first season getting acclimated to the league and fighting for the Four Star Cup, and afterward, you'll be drafted by one of the 20 Simulation Hockey League (SHL) teams. Work hard, stay active, and you could earn the prestige of being the 1st overall draft pick!\n\n**BE-A-PRO EXPERIENCE** \\- A rich, personal hockey experience that crosses between video games and fantasy hockey. Build your player exactly how you want with a variety of different styles. Be totally involved in your player from the beginning, and take them from rookie to the SHL Hall of Fame! Every game is simulated on Franchise Hockey Manager 8, and its wide array of attributes allows you to customize your player to the maximum. Success is based on your activity within our community, so the more involved you are, the greater your player can be! Check out our YouTube channel here to see what our live streams are like! [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYxFJhOSYFP4gLxDOEiHdVA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYxFJhOSYFP4gLxDOEiHdVA)\n\n**IT IS FREE** \\- The best part is that our community/site is entirely free. It's free to join, participate, and do what you want. Our league runs off the hard work of our community members, and we all serve each other in that regard. We\u2019re always looking for new members to fuel the already great community we have built!\n\n**DRAFT DAY** \\- Experience waiting for your name to be selected alongside your draftmates, vying for that top spot! This is a full draft experience where real people will draft you and spend their resources on your potential. Become the next big steal or potentially the next big bust. Show the GMs you\u2019ve got what it takes to be the face of their franchise!\n\n**REAL PEOPLE, REAL OWNERS** \\- Every aspect of the league is run by real people from all around the world! Your draftmates, future teammates, general managers, and the league\u2019s head office are all real people you can interact with. Every decision from team lineups, draft day selections, and last minute trade deadline deals are done by teams owned by site members, with plenty of opportunity for you to fill in those roles yourself! SHL superstar, team captain or scout, General Manager, Head Office; the site is full of opportunities for you to get involved however you choose!\n\n**COMMUNITY** \\- Once your player is drafted onto a team, you will gain access to a private locker room for your organization and their Discord server (should you choose to join there). Here is often where the closest relationships develop and where you\u2019ll make some great new friends to share your SHL journey with!

He participated as a member of the Toronto Marlboros and was affiliated with both the Detroit Red Wings and the New York Rangers. Following active service as a Lieutenant in the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War, he captained the RAF Flyers to a gold medal victory at the 1948\nWinter Olympic Games in St. Moritz, Switzerland.\n\n\nHe joined the family business, the William Mara Company, where he built a successful career as an\nimporter of wines and spirits, followed by his term as Vice Chairman of annock Ltd.\n\n\nThroughout his life, he was involved in the creation and operation of many business ventures, boards of directors and charitable organizations, particularly those relating to Canadian sports. He was the founder and inaugural Chairman of the Olympic Trust of Canada, the fundraising arm of the Canadian Olympic Association, which raised millions of dollars to help support Canadian athletes. For many years, he was a Director of Maple Leaf Gardens and briefly served as President. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in recognition of his service to sports. He was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame as both an athlete and a builder, and later he was named to Canada's Sports Hall of Fame\n\n\nUCC was always a focus for Mr. Mara's interest and support. He served on the Principal's Advisory Council, as Chairman of the Renaissance XXI Capital Campaign and was instrumental in the initiation of this facility. His knowledge of hockey and his passion for UCC informed his advice on future expectations of the game, which is reflected in this building and particularly in the presence of this international rink.\n\n\nSadly, he died in 2006 before he could see the building's completion. However, he showed his commitment to hockey and to the boys of UCC by making a historically important bequest for the development of this facility.\n\n\nHe and his wife Peggy (Roddick) were the parents of Diane and George '67.\n\n\nUCC is proud to name the Olympic rink in honour of George Mara, one of the greatest athletes in the history of the College, who served it with loyalty and dedication throughout his life.\n\n\nMay his memory continue to inspire the desire to make a difference and to achieve excellence, always in the presence of humility, humour and grace.*", "date": "20231111", "sentiment": 0.9962}, {"ranking": 0.5308641975308642, "comments": "GDT - Saturday November 11, 2023 | Jets vs Stars @ 2pm CT &amp;#x200B;\n\n# [Winnipeg Jets       -VS-       Dallas Stars](https://www.canadalifecentre.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2122JETS019_Website-Matchup-Graphics_600x340_STARS_v1.jpg)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|**Jets**|**Stars**|\n|:--:|:--:|\n|W/L/OTL - 3rd Central|W/L/OTL - 1st Central|\n|7-4-2-W3|8-3-1-W1|\n\n**^(Arena: Canada Life Centre, Winnipeg MB)**\n***\n\n***Projected Lineup:***\n\n|LW|Center|RW|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|**Kyle Connor**|**Mark Scheifele** (A)|**Alex Iafallo**|\n|**Cole Perfetti**|**Vladislav Namestnikov**|**Nikolaj Ehlers**|\n|**Nino Niederreiter**|**Adam Lowry** (C)|**Mason Appleton**|\n|**Morgan Barron**|**David Gustafsson**|**Rasmus Kupari**|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Left D|Right D|\n|:--:|:--:|\n|**Josh Morrissey** (A)|**Dylan DeMelo**|\n|**Brenden Dillon**|**Neal Pionk**|\n|**Dylan Samberg**|**Nate Schmidt**|\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n|Goaltenders|\n|:--:|\n|**Connor Hellebuyck** (starting)|\n|**Laurent Brossoit**|\n\n**Injuries:**\n\n* [**Dallas Stars**](https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/injuries/_/name/dal)**:**\n* [**Winnipeg Jets**](https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/injuries/_/name/wpg)**:** D Ville Heinola (IR), F Gabriel Vilardi (IR)\n\n**Jets Pressbox:**\n* **D Logan Stanley, D Declan Chisholm**\n***\n**Live updates and goal videos** on [NHL Gamecenter.](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/dal-vs-wpg/2023/11/11/2023020211)\n\n**Watch:**  TSN3 with Dan Robertson and Kevin Sawyer; find a stream at [Sportsurge](https://v2.sportsurge.net/list-hockey)\n\n**Listen:** [CJOB 680 AM](https://globalnews.ca/radio/cjob/player/#/) or [Power 97 FM](https://power97.com/player/) with Paul Edmonds and Mitchell Clinton\n***\nSubreddit rules can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/winnipegjets/about/rules/)", "date": "20231111", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.5308641975308642, "comments": "Who comes out?

Reminds me a little of Noah Gregor.\n\n\\-Blackwood continues to impress.\n\n\\-Everybody on the team (with a few exceptions) has been playing hard.\n\nFinally, i'll wrap this up by saying that, its tough to see but Labanc and Vlasic are liabilities and just don't have it anymore.  I expect this to be Labanc's last year with us.  I have no idea what we are going to do with Vlasic but its tough to see him like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "date": "20231128", "sentiment": 0.9929}, {"ranking": 0.2802547770700637, "comments": "Where in the world is Couture?

Should we lock him in for low money but a bunch of years?  If he'll agree to even 3 mil x 8, that's seems like it could work out in the long run. Worst comes to pass, 3 mill isn't a ton to be spending on a backup with the cap increases year after year and he'll be 30 when we start coming into a competitive window.\n\nI know we are all scarred by 8 year contracts in years passed, but I feel like it could be a low risk high reward move for us.

Musty is coming off a recent hat trick and above a ppg pace for the season in OHL. Cagnoni is second in defensemen in scoring (but 1st in ppg based on games played) in WHL. Smith is 8th in ppg(3rd among freshman) in NCAA div 1. Bordeleau and Gushchin are on pace to score more goals and points than their previous AHL seasons.

He's dumb, but at least he apologizes. ([0:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI9sfcfPqg&amp;t=13s))  \n\nBut before we get to that, Keegan and Sheng get to some of the big news surrounding the San Jose Sharks.

([4:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI9sfcfPqg&amp;t=270s))   \n\nWe give Ryan Carpenter tons of credit for stabilizing San Jose up the middle. ([5:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI9sfcfPqg&amp;t=315s))  \n\nWho will the Sharks replace Sturm with at center during the upcoming road trip? We speculate about Luke Kunin or Thomas Bordeleau. ([7:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI9sfcfPqg&amp;t=435s))  \n\nNext, we talk about why William Eklund got benched for half a period. We touch on David Quinn\u2019s track record with younger players, good and bad, focusing on Pavel Buchnevich. ([18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI9sfcfPqg&amp;t=1120s))  \n\nWhat does Danil Gushchin have to do to stay up with the San Jose Sharks? In Sheng\u2019s mind, it\u2019s not just about production. We have plenty of back-and-forth regarding the merits of Gushchin in the AHL vs. the NHL. ([40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI9sfcfPqg&amp;t=2400s))  \n\nWhat discuss Mike Hoffman\u2019s mini-resurgence and how he's gotten back to his goal-scoring ways. ([58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTI9sfcfPqg&amp;t=3525s))  \n\nFinally, maybe the best examples on the San Jose Sharks right now of not writing players off too quickly, we chat about what we can learn about their surprising leading goalscorers Kunin and Fabian Zetterlund.

It just seems to me that this recent injury and all of the \"setbacks\" has proven to me as a San Jose Sharks fan is truly how expendible Logan is both in the captaincy circle and his place on this team. Yes I agree the team will get better when he comes back because of the offense he provides but I just don't believe it's enough to truly make a difference especially in this year, and it seems like his goal totals were trending in the downward direction.

Our third period came to a halt against an aggressive team. We hit some posts, had a couple of wonky pucks, and ultimately gave up an easy goal to take 1 point. Yes, last year, we looked aggressive all season (for the most part, even though there were def some flat footed and low moments\u2026February 2023 anyone?) \n\nHowever, there are two things that give me perspective after the Calgary game. 1) It seems to me that PDB is making small adjustments to strategy every game. As someone who coaches myself, you have to look at what the goal is, what steps you can take to get there, and what kind of timeframe you need to set for improvement. I trust PDB and what I saw tonight and against Winnipeg was a team willing to work defensively together. Yes, there were moments (Miro ducking, Robo leaving Calgary wide open in OT), but for the most part I thought the last two games were more in line with a team that doesn\u2019t give up game winning leads to Calgary (A one goal lead is the hardest lead to hold modern hockey and is not a game winning lead in the NHL, especially in the third period) and CO. Next step I imagine is combining that back with good offensive effort. \n\nSecond thing that gives me perspective. At the end of November 2022 we were 13-6-4. At the end of November 2023 we are 13-5-3. Also, last year we went 1-2 against Calgary and this year we went 1-1-1. Sometimes, you have to step back so you can get some perspective, it\u2019s a long season.

We rode the light rail to the station and it drops you off right outside the arena, not across a parking lot. A few dogs in attendance were highlighted on the video board. They beat the Lightning. Fans were cool when I said I was a Stars fan. \n\nCons: you have to sit amongst Avs fans. They don\u2019t yell \u201cStars!\u201d during the anthem. They yell something about the flag still there but whatevs. Their mascot is a dog. They cram \u201cLet\u2019s go Av-a-lanche\u201d into a cheer, sounds ridiculous. \n\nOverall highly recommend checking out a game at Ball Arena.

So I recently got me a Seguin jersey with the black and neon green, known as the bad luck colors, that has everything sewn on. I love it and I try to wear it as much as possible, despite the south Texas heat. However, my dilemma is I'm trying to find an older jersey and I'm not sure what to look out for or what's considered a good, quality jersey.

", "date": "20231201", "sentiment": 0.0}, {"ranking": 0.6050955414012739, "comments": "Quarter Season in Review So now that we have played 23 games and have crossed into the 2nd quarter of the season, I thought it would be fun to evaluate where we are.\n\nOverall I'm very pleased with the way this team has opened the season.  We are sitting 2nd in the East and the Atlantic behind Boston.  The impressive part of this is that we were missing three critical pieces (considering last year's playoffs) for most of the quarter.  Without Ekblad, Montour and Bennett, I was prepared to say a game over .500 would have been acceptable.  That is basically 2 of our top 3 defensemen (including Forsling in the mix), and our most punishing power forward.  Subtract Gudas and Duclair and not knowing how players picked up in the offseason would adapt to their new roles in a new system, and I was definitely hoping for the best but expecting a slow start.  Obviously the Panthers have far exceeded my expectations this quarter.\n\nOffensively there have been struggles finishing chances that are presented.  Averaging 3 goals/game puts us in the bottom third of the league as does the 17.9% powerplay conversion rate.  But both of those stats seem to be on the upswing in the last few games as lines are starting to gel and produce points more consistently.  I anticipate the offense will be spread out amongst the usual players rather than Reinhart scoring more than his share as the season goes on, and Barkov/Tkachuk (and others) start to produce points more similar to their historical rate\n\nDefensively we started off better.  4th in league in goals against/game (2.48), 3rd in the league in shots allowed/game (27.61) and 13th in the league in PK% with 82.5% fueled by this recent 26/26 successful PK kill run.  Barkov has had an epic start to the season defensively with easily Selke finalist shoe-in defensive statistics.  While his offensive numbers haven't been what we are used to, don't make any mistake about it, his influence on this team, and his ability to absolutely shut down the most talented forwards in the league is absolutely massive.  We will live or die with our captain and his success at both ends of the ice.  His ability to play any situation, 5v5, 3v3 OT, PP, PK, penalty shots, and just know he's going to be elite is such a luxury to have for a team like us and a coach like Maurice.\n\nGoaltending has been quite good for us as well.  4th in the league in GAA, and 6th in SV%.  Certainly combined with our team defensive statistics, this has been an important part of our early season success.\n\nMost important, the off season additions have shown that Bill Zito and his scouting staff have done a GREAT job in finding pieces that fit within our system at a price that we can afford to pay.  Evan Rodrigues has had a slow start on the offensive stat line, but has been part of that top line and playing well defensively, Stenlund has been a huge presence, and is at his career high goal production already.   Gadjovich has stepped in and been the tough sandpaper edge that we lost with Gudas.  The trio of Kulikov, Mikkola and OEL are all showing that they have plenty of life left and are looking like bargain steals with their play and production.  It isn't easy to find these pieces in the hard cap era, and the front office should be commended.\n\nSumming up we are way ahead of where we were last season.  Now that Maurice's system has been in place for the second year in a row, we have shown none of the new system growing pains like we did at the beginning of last year.  Barring any massive unforseen changes or injuries, it should be nice to have a playoff spot locked up earlier in the year and to have our own destiny in our hands.

There were rumors that he was going to turn pro after this season. Considering how he's been playing, it would be a nice glimpse of the future. I would imagine the Hawks are going to take a serious look at him once the college season is over.\n\nOliver Moore Forward - Through 14 games, Moore has 10 points (2 goals, 8 assists). The secondary scoring has been nice, but hopefully he can find the back of the net a little more. He is only a freshman at Minnesota so it could just be some learning/growing pains. I don't think he's someone that's going to turn pro after this season/could benefit from another year in college. \n\nColton Dach Forward - Through 11 games at Rockford, Dach is performing nicely with 10 points (5 goals, 5 assists). He's been on a bit of a hot streak lately, with 7 points in his last 5 games, including a hat trick performance. He might be someone that could get a courtesy callup towards the end of the year, but probably needs another season at Rockford. He's probably going to be a bottom 6 guy, who could reach middle 6 status every now and then. \n\nSam Rinzel Defenseman - Rinzel was drafted with the mindset that he was going to be a long term project. His freshman year at Minnesota seems to reflect that. He's been up and down with 14 games played with 9 points (0 goals, 9 assists). He's been doing better as of late with 3 points in his last 5 games, but this is someone that is going to need some more time. I can see him turning pro after his junior season, but the Blackhawks certainly will preach patience, considering the glut of defensive prospects they have.\n\nLandon Slaggert Forward - Slaggert made the decision to return to Notre Dame and so far it's paid off quite nicely. Through 14 games, he's got 14 points (10 goals, 4 assists) and already has more goals than he did all of last season. I don't think there is any doubt that Slaggert turns pro after this year, and I believe he's got the skills to be a bottom 6 forward on the team. \n\nRyan Greene - Forward - Greene has been quietly putting together a solid season for Boston University. I'm sure part of that is playing with Celebrini, but so far he's put together a point - per - game pace (6 goals, 8 assists in 14 games). Like most of the other Hawks prospects, he's projected to be a bottom 6 player. I think he's going to stay another season at BU to further hone his skills and we could see him in a hawks sweater in a couple seasons. \n\nThe Blackhawks prospect pool is starting to come together nicely, and they were already rated a top 5 prospect pool according to the Athletic's Corey Pronman. That's only going to increase as the Hawks continue to stock pile high draft picks (they've got 7 picks as of right now in the first 3 rounds). Hopefully these guys, and the rest of the draft picks, continue to improve.

I am travelling to Chicago from Toronto this Friday to watch the Leafs take on the Hawks. I would love to hear your suggestions on what to do when inside the arena and then post game in Chicago. This will be my first time going to Chicago. I will only be in town from about 11am pre game until about 7pm post game as I am heading back towards Pittsburgh to watch the leafs again on Saturday. I see about 25 leafs home games per year and so now I think it\u2019s time to start watching the team in other cities and this will be my first road game outside of watching them in Buffalo. \n\nSo the actual questions are what are the best food options in the arena? What areas of the arena should I visit? Are there any cool memorabilia items I can purchase from the store (at Scotiabank Arena you can purchase warm up pucks post game)?  I will have about 3-4 hours after the game to tour the city, what are the best spots? And if you could pick one place to have dinner in Chicago for the first and probably last time in your life where would it be?\n\nI look forward to hearing all your suggestions and taking part in your arena atmosphere this holiday weekend.", "date": "20231118", "sentiment": 0.9831}, {"ranking": 0.3248407643312102, "comments": "Game Thread: Chicago Blackhawks (5-9-0) at Nashville Predators (5-10-0) - 18 Nov 2023 - 1:00PM CST [](/2023020256)\n\n**[Link to comment with all tables.](/r/hawks/comments/17y9i5y/game_thread_chicago_blackhawks_590_at_nashville/k9rytxe/)**\n\n# Chicago [](/r/hawks) Blackhawks (5-9-0) at Nashville [](/r/predators) Predators (5-10-0)\n\n#Bridgestone Arena\n\n##In-Game Updates\n\n***\n\n|Time Clock|\n|:--:|\n|FINAL|\n\n|Teams|1st|2nd|3rd|Total|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|[CHI](/r/hawks)|0|1|1|2|\n|[NSH](/r/predators)|2|1|1|4|\n\n##Team Stats\n\n|Team|Shots|Hits|Blocks|FOW%|Giveaways|Takeaways|Power Play|PIM|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|[CHI](/r/hawks)|31|29|9|43.9%|10|7|0/2|6|\n|[NSH](/r/predators)|32|28|14|56.1%|9|8|1/3|4|\n\n##Goals\n\n|Period|Time|Team|Strength|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|1st|12:07|[NSH](/r/predators)|Even|[Yakov Trenin (1) wrist shot, assist(s): Colton Sissons (2)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341402503112)|\n|1st|18:32|[NSH](/r/predators)|Power Play|[Gustav Nyquist (2) wrist shot, assist(s): Ryan O'Reilly (7), Filip Forsberg (12)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341403197112)|\n|2nd|13:05|[CHI](/r/hawks)|Even|[Philipp Kurashev (3) wrist shot, assist(s): Connor Bedard (5), Seth Jones (7)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341402756112)|\n|2nd|16:20|[NSH](/r/predators)|Even|[Cole Smith (3) wrist shot, assist(s): Philip Tomasino (2), Michael McCarron (2)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341404325112)|\n|3rd|12:15|[CHI](/r/hawks)|Even|[Tyler Johnson (5) wrist shot, assist(s): Jason Dickinson (5)](https://players.brightcove.net/6415718365001/EXtG1xJ7H_default/index.html?videoId=6341406332112)|\n|3rd|19:48|[NSH](/r/predators)|Even|Cole Smith (4) wrist shot, assist(s): None|\n\n\n##Penalties\n\n|Period|Time|Team|Type|Min|Description|\n|:--:|:--:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|1st|00:25|[NSH](/r/predators)|MIN|2|Alexandre Carrier cross-checking against Nick Foligno|\n|1st|14:13|[CHI](/r/hawks)|MIN|2|Lukas Reichel holding against Juuso Parssinen|\n|1st|17:12|[CHI](/r/hawks)|MIN|2|Corey Perry tripping against Philip Tomasino|\n|2nd|16:55|[CHI](/r/hawks)|MIN|2|Corey Perry interference against Cole Smith|\n|3rd|00:55|[NSH](/r/predators)|MIN|2|Yakov Trenin high-sticking against Alex Vlasic|\n\n\n**Officials**\n\n* Referees: Corey Syvret, Chris Lee\n* Linesmen: Kyle Flemington, Kilian McNamara\n\n***\n\n\n\n##Time\n\n|PT|MT|CT|ET|AT|UTC|\n|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n|11:00AM|12:00PM|1:00PM|2:00PM|3:00PM|7:00PM|##Game Info:\n\n|||\n|:--:|:--:|\n|TV|NBCSCH, BSSO|\n|Other|[Preview](https://www.nhl.com/news/chicago-blackhawks-nashville-predators-game-preview-november-18) - [Boxscore](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/2023020256/boxscore) - [Recap](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/2023020256/recap)|\n|GameCenter|[On NHL.com](https://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/2023020256/playbyplay)|\n\n\r\n##Keep it civil, and be excellent to each other!\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n##Discord Server Info\r\n\r\n##[Click here](https://discord.gg/wxBSRH7) to join our  /r/hawks Discord server\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### LET'S GO HAWKS!

Going deeper into their TV listings I found two Coyotes scheduled next week on November 20th and 22th in place of CW programming, and other changes to their schedule that have nothing to do with the Coyotes. I also noticed The CW programming on Coyotes game days is nowhere to be found, not even being preempted and aired at a different time. Not seeing it listed on a different channel yet either. I have a feeling KASW 61 hasn't finished updating their schedule with TV listings providers yet. Looking at a multi-day, multi-time TV listing on TitanTV, KASW's schedule on non-Coyotes game days is normal and may not have been updated yet.

Karlsson makes sense to me, as he's been high on my lists in the past, particularly in Vegas' inaugural season.\n\nEichel, however, is a big surprise to me. I've only thought of his as a scoring forward, but the results suggest he's an elite PK forward with a lot of shot blocks and takeaways. On the other hand, his face-offs aren't very good and his puck possession is mediocre, but those seem to be heavily outweighed by the positives.\n\nWhat does the eye test tell you guys?

Here are my takeaways\u2026\n\nSizing-\nThese jerseys are indeed a tad bit smaller than the home/road counterparts. I ordered the same size as I normally get but I like my jerseys slim. If you\u2019re on the edge of sizing, size up. \n\nStitched vs heat pressed numbers- \nThe location I went to had stitched Grubi, Burky, Eberle, Tanev, and McCann WC jerseys. They can make any other jerseys custom (heat pressed). I wanted a 46 McCann, but they didn\u2019t have that size in stitched so I custom ordered and settled for heat pressed. \n\nThe stitched and heat pressed numbers look and feel exactly the same. I couldn\u2019t tell a difference. It might feel slightly different while wearing it but durability concerns aside it\u2019s a total wash.\n\nThe custom name lettering is slightly larger. And I mean slightly. Literally probably 1mm wider per letter. On that note, If you want a Bjorkstrand jersey, you need to order a size 54 or larger for it to fit on the back. \ud83d\ude04\n\nJersey stock- \nEmployees had no idea if/when stitched jerseys would be back in stock. There\u2019s at least a possibility they\u2019ll sell what\u2019s left and that\u2019s it. Wouldn\u2019t surprise me at all. Team store employee mentioned that NHL/Adidas massively underestimated the demand. \n\nCustom numbers/nameplates stock- \nThe Iceplex location had boxes of numbers and nameplates. The employee didn\u2019t seem concerned that they were running out in the near future. \n\nOkay here\u2019s the biggest news-\n\nThe Iceplex manager told me that the team stores might not be willing to customize jerseys without the WC patch (aka jerseys bought from Fanatics/NHL shop). Not sure if this is speculation or fact, but it\u2019s believable if they do in fact have a shortage on name/number kits. Or maybe it was a sales ploy to get me to buy my jersey there. Idk but it worked \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nIf anyone has any other questions, feel free to ask.

Which can be purchased separately. The jerseys from the NHL shop currently cost less due to the lack of the patch.\n\nI went with the custom authentic player jersey from the NHL shop online since they have all sizes available and I am not able to take a blank into the Lair for customization. I could be wrong but I believe it's easier and less expensive to only have the patch added, compared to full customization with letters and numbers.\n\nAnother point of interest with these jersey's is that the lettering &amp; numbers are pre sewn felt/twill elements. There might be potential for shortages or no availability at some point to source the correct pre sewn felt/twill elements for customization down the line.\n\nPricing works out to be about the same going this route, but does ensure you get your desired size with the correct pre sewn lettering/number elements. If there is any other difference I missed, please let me know! Hope this helps anyone trying to track down their desired jersey &amp; size.\n\nDirect links for NHL Shop authentic custom jersey &amp; patch:\n\n[https://shop.nhl.com/seattle-kraken/mens-seattle-kraken-adidas-deep-sea-blue-2024-nhl-winter-classic-primegreen-authentic-custom-jersey](https://shop.nhl.com/seattle-kraken/mens-seattle-kraken-adidas-deep-sea-blue-2024-nhl-winter-classic-primegreen-authentic-custom-jersey)\n\n[https://shop.nhl.com/nhl-multi-team/seattle-kraken-vs-vegas-golden-knights-2024-nhl-winter-classic-emblem-jersey-patch](https://shop.nhl.com/nhl-multi-team/seattle-kraken-vs-vegas-golden-knights-2024-nhl-winter-classic-emblem-jersey-patch)", "date": "20231122", "sentiment": 0.9601}, {"comments": "Daily Thread - November 23, 2023 Welcome to the /r/SeattleKraken Daily Thread!
